<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> was during the early days of the recent insurrection that
I first thought of utilising my spare time by writing some
account of what was taking place around me, and these rough
notes, written at odd moments during the campaign, I intended
to have sent to the <i>Field</i> for publication in that
journal, in the form of a series of articles dealing entirely
with my own personal experiences. After the disbandment
of the Bulawayo Field Force, however, and my own resignation
as an officer in that corps, finding that I had leisure to
do so, I determined to amplify these notes, and give some
account of every skirmish which had taken place between
the Colonists and the natives in Matabeleland up to the date
of the disbandment of the above-mentioned Force. To this
I add a short account of my personal experiences in the
country during the months immediately preceding the outbreak
of the insurrection, and finding that I had then sufficient
material to fill the covers of a small book, I abandoned my
original idea of getting what I had written published in
weekly numbers, and determined for the third time to launch
a book—always about Africa—on the long-suffering British
public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">What I have written as it were historically regarding the
events which have lately taken place in Matabeleland may,
I think, be received as a simple and unadorned statement of
fact, for where I have had to go outside my own personal
experiences, my information has always been obtained at
first hand and checked by the corroborating accounts of
others who were also eye-witnesses of the events described.
As to any conclusions I may have arrived at from given facts,
they may be right or they may be wrong, but at any rate I
claim the right to express my opinions frankly and fearlessly
as long as they are my honest convictions. It may be said
that, as I am a friend of Mr. Cecil Rhodes and of Dr. Jameson,
I ought not to have expressed the opinion that it was the
removal of the police force from Matabeleland to the Transvaal
which gave the natives their opportunity to revolt, since
the expression of such an opinion may be held to reflect upon
the administration of the Chartered Company. My reply is,
that I have written a history, which, to have any value, must be
truthful, and that as Dr. Jameson cannot lay claim to infallibility,
he was, like other mortals, liable to err. When he left
Matabeleland he never dreamt that the removal of the police
force would have any more effect upon the Matabele than
the disbandment of the police in Mashunaland in 1891 had
had upon the natives in that country. This opinion, moreover,
must have been shared by the great majority of the
inhabitants of Matabeleland, since no remonstrance was made
by any public man at the time that the police left Bulawayo.
We now know that the removal of the white police force
was a mistake; but it is easy to criticise after the event, and
as at the time the mistake was made no one in Rhodesia was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
wise or prescient enough to foresee the possible effect it might
have on the natives of Matabeleland, it would be the height
of meanness and injustice to hold Dr. Jameson morally
responsible for the present insurrection.</p>

<p class="i1">Judging from the knowledge which we now possess of the
secret history of the rebellion, it appears that the leaders of
the movement must long ago have determined to revolt whenever
a favourable opportunity occurred, and a rebellion would
therefore in all probability have taken place sooner or later;
so perhaps it is as well to have had it and got over it at the
same time as the rinderpest. The latter plague will have far
more lasting effects than the native rising; but when the
railway from the south reaches Bulawayo, the country will
once again be able to make a fair start, for with the greater
knowledge now possessed by the authorities of the native
character, the outcome of which will be a complete reorganisation
of the native administration, no farther insurrection
ought to be possible. For the rest, it is very evident that the
Matabele broke out in rebellion because they disliked their
position as a conquered people, and imagined that they were
strong enough to throw off the yoke of their conquerors. But
I fail to see that the fact that they have rebelled is any more
an indictment against the general principles of the government
of the Chartered Company, than were the numerous
rebellions which have taken place from time to time in the
Cape Colony an indictment against the wisdom and justice of
the Imperial Government.</p>

<p class="i1">Now that the rebellion has occurred, it will very possibly
be said that it was brought about by systematic brutality to
the natives on the part of the white men in the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Such an allegation, however, cannot be supported by facts,
for, as the records of the magistrates' court will prove, the
present Government has done all that any other civilised
Government could have done to protect the natives from ill-treatment
at the hands of irresponsible individuals; and as a
native commissioner thoroughly conversant with the Matabele
language, and well in touch with the people, was stationed
in each of the districts into which the country has been
divided, it cannot be urged that the natives had no opportunity
of making their grievances known. Grievances of course
they had, the chief of which, doubtless, was the loss of their
independence as a nation, and the fact that they found themselves
treated as a conquered people lately engaged in
hostilities, who had only been permitted to return to the
country from which they had been driven at the time of the
first war under certain conditions, one of which was that the
indunas should, through the medium of the native commissioners,
supply miners and farmers with native labour—all
the able-bodied young men in the country being required to
work for a certain number of months per annum at a fixed
rate of pay. This rate of pay was fixed at 10s. a month with
food; but as a matter of fact mining work was almost always
paid much more highly, as much as 30s. a month with food
being often given for unskilled labour, whilst the managers of
mines made it their business to see that the boys in their
Company's employ were well treated, and cruel treatment by
individuals was, I do not hesitate to say, the exception to the
rule. Owing to the excessive indolence of the people, however,
there can be no doubt that the labour regulations were
most irksome to them. The indunas grew more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
disinclined to exert their authority in the matter of inducing
their people to work when applications were made to them,
with the result that native policemen were sent to their
kraals to insist on the labour regulations being carried out,
and these policemen, I fear, sometimes exceeded their duties,
and used their position to tyrannise over the people.</p>

<p class="i1">I remember well that when Umlugulu
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> visited me for the
first time, after I had taken up my residence on Essexvale,
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he
complained bitterly of the high-handed manner in which
the "Ama Policey Minyama," the "Black Police," behaved
to him and his people. "I have no complaints to make,"
he said, "against the white policemen; but the black police,
wa duba, wa duba sebele—they give me trouble; they
really give me trouble." I myself complained to the acting
Administrator, Mr. Duncan, concerning the inconsiderate
manner in which it appeared to me that the labour regulations
were sometimes carried out, and I was led to believe
that the whole question of native administration would
shortly be gone into by the Government, and all grievances
remedied.</p>

<p class="i1">The cattle question I have dealt with in the course of my
story. It was never sagaciously handled, and its mismanagement
probably caused more discontent against the Chartered
Company's rule amongst the pure-blooded Matabele, or
Abenzantsi, than anything else, whilst the irritation excited
by the regulation exacting a certain amount of paid labour
yearly from every able-bodied man produced a feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
bitterness and discontent throughout the other classes of the
community, which made them ripe for rebellion when they
were called to arms by the leaders of the insurrection. However,
although no impartial critic can deny that the confiscation
of so large a number of their cattle, and more especially
the manner in which that confiscation was carried out, was
impolitic if not ungenerous; whilst the manner in which the
labour regulations were enforced was sometimes calculated
to provoke serious discontent; yet neither of these causes, nor
both combined, would, in my opinion, have been sufficient to
induce the mass of the population to break out in rebellion
had there not been amongst them many men who, having
once belonged to the ruling class in the country, were so
dissatisfied at their loss of position and power under the
white man's rule, that they had determined to regain their
independence as a nation, or to attempt to do so, on the first
favourable opportunity which offered. The rebellion was not
the spontaneous act of the mass of the people goaded to
desperation by an insupportable tyranny. It was a drama
into which they were surprised, and in many cases dragged
against their better judgment, by a few leading spirits, who
planned and carried out the first murders and utilised the
Makalaka Umlimo,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as a prophet.</p>

<p class="i1">To show that neither the cattle nor the labour questions
were the only causes of the rebellion, I may mention that on
Mr. Arthur Rhodes' block of farms on the Impembisi river,
extending to some 50,000 acres, there was a considerable
native population which had been altogether exempted from
the general labour regulations—although required to supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Mr. Arthur Rhodes himself with any labour necessary on the
farm for agricultural purposes; whilst there had been distributed
amongst them 1600 head of cattle, which they held,
in addition to their own, on exactly the same terms on which
they had been formerly accustomed to tend cattle for Lo
Bengula. Now here was a population living, one would have
thought, in a state of the most absolute contentment—for
they were receiving the full benefit of the milk from a far
larger number of cattle than they had ever had to look after
in Lo Bengula's time; had been allowed to build their kraals
wherever they thought fit, make use of whatever land they
desired for cultivation, and in fact to lead their own life in
their own way undisturbed by any one, for the number of
boys who came voluntarily to ask for employment was far in
excess of what was required for agricultural work on the
estate. And yet, when the rebellion broke out, these people
to a man (always excepting Captain Fynn's Delagoa Bay
boy) joined the insurgents, and not only burnt down Mr.
Arthur Rhodes' homestead and swept off all his cattle, but
murdered Mr. Edwards the surveyor, who happened to be
working in the neighbourhood; against whom they could
have had no personal animus, as he was a complete stranger
to them. Then, again, if any one had heard the natives
living in the villages close round my homestead on Essexvale
singing and dancing as they were wont to do on every moonlight
night, he could not have maintained that they appeared
to be weighed down by a sense of injustice and oppression,
or, in fact, that they were anything but joyous and happy.
It is very difficult to understand the workings of a Kafir's
mind, as any one must admit who has lived long amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
natives, but the fact that the Matabele broke out into rebellion
against the Government of the Chartered Company, appears
to me to be no proof of any special iniquity <i>per se</i> on the
part of that Government, since history has shown us, that
wherever a savage race, entirely unaccustomed to order and
restraint, has been conquered by a highly civilised people,
who have forthwith essayed to govern that savage race as
humanely as possible, but after all in their own interests
rather than in the interests of the conquered people, a rebellion
against the more intelligent ruling class has been the result;
for the ways of the civilised man are not the ways of the
savage, who, there can be no doubt, would rather put up with
all the ills from which we consider we have freed him, than
be subject to the restraints of a settled form of Government.
Practically, he says "hang your <i>Pax Britanica</i>"; give me
the good old times of superstition and bloodshed; then, even
if I did not know the day nor the hour when I might be
"smelt out" as a witch, and forthwith knocked on the head,
at any rate I could have basked in the sun until my time
came; and then, too, when the "impi" went forth, what
glorious times I had, and how I revelled in blood and loot!</p>

<p class="i1">As to any general charges of systematic injustice and
cruelty towards the natives, which may and will now be
made by the personal enemies of Mr. Rhodes, against the
Chartered Company, with the object of providing a justification
for the brutal murders of European women and children
which have been committed during the present rebellion, I
would point out that such charges come rather late in the
day, for the natives of Matabeleland had lived for over two
years in an apparently fairly contented condition under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
Government of the Company before the rebellion broke out,
and during the whole of that time there were four missionaries
belonging to the London Missionary Society, besides some
people called "seventh-day adventists"—whatever that may
mean, for I have not the least idea myself—all of whom were
working amongst, and avowedly for the benefit of, the natives.
Now, if systematic cruelty, injustice, and oppression of the
Matabele by the Government of the Chartered Company had
been going on constantly for over two years, it must have
been very well known to all these men, and it was their duty
not only to have protested against such gross misgovernment
to the Company's Administrator in Bulawayo, but also to
have reported such abuses to their Directors in England. No
such allegations, however, were ever made prior to the
rebellion, and should any be now brought forward they
ought to be received with the very gravest suspicion. The
fact, too, remains that although individual acts of brutality
have occurred in Matabeleland—as they have done in every
other country in the world—during the last two years, and
although mistakes have been made, especially in dealing with
the cattle and labour questions, yet, on the whole, the conditions
under which the natives in that territory were living,
were such that no one resident in the country, whether
missionary or miner, imagined before the rebellion broke out
that there could be any deep-seated discontent amongst
them. That the government of the natives has been all that
was desirable from their point of view I do not say, as it is
my opinion that, when a black man's country has been conquered
by Europeans, the laws by which that country will be
subsequently governed will be made in the interests of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
whites, and some of them will be very unpalatable to the
conquered race, however just and equitable they may seem to
their rulers. We Europeans make the mistake of thinking
that, when we free a tribe of savages from what we consider a
most oppressive and tyrannical form of government, substituting
in its place an orderly rule, under which every man's
life and property is protected and witch-doctors are not
recognised, we ought to earn their gratitude; but the fact is
we invariably fail to do so, as the present insurrection, as well
as all the many rebellions by the natives of the Cape Colony
against the rule of the Imperial Government has shown. Yet,
as in the Cape Colony, so also will it be in Matabeleland.
The savages will discover the uselessness of rebelling against
the white man, and as time goes on will become more reconciled
to the ways of their conquerors; that is, if their grievances
are inquired into and as far as possible remedied, as I have
every hope and belief that they will be as soon as the present
rebellion has come to an end; for not until mutual confidence
has again been restored between the whites and the blacks can
Rhodesia prosper. From the black man's point of view the
white man is probably not necessary as a factor in the prosperity
of the country. He could get along very well without
him. Unfortunately we cannot manage without the black
man; he is absolutely necessary for the development of the
country on the white man's lines. But a sulky, rebellious
black man, only held in subjection by fear, is both a useless
and dangerous personality, and, therefore, the dictates of
policy will be at one with the promptings of humanity, in
demanding that the natives of Matabeleland shall be governed
both kindly and justly as well as firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">One word more. In the following pages I have given
descriptions of many barbarous deeds which have lately been
committed in Matabeleland. I have hidden nothing, but
have told the naked truth, and related not only how white
men, women, and children were lately murdered, and their
senseless bodies afterwards cruelly mutilated by black men,
but also how, subsequently, black men were shot down
pitilessly by the whites, no mercy being shown or quarter
given them by the outraged colonists. By those who seek it,
matter will doubtless be found in some of my stories on
which to found imputations against the colonists of Rhodesia,
who will be held up to execration for the "slaughter" of
"poor natives"; the insinuation being that the "poor
natives" were ruthlessly killed, with little or no provocation,
in order to gratify the lust for blood, which certain people in
England appear to think takes possession of their countrymen
whenever they set foot on African soil. But by the great
mass of the English-speaking race I feel sure that the conduct
of their kith and kin in Matabeleland during the late rebellion
will not be too harshly judged. It will be remembered that
they were the avengers of the women and children of their
own colour, who had but lately been so mercilessly slain,
and that, fighting as they were against hordes of savages
eager to spill the life-blood of every white man in Rhodesia,
savages in whose vocabulary no such words as pity or mercy
are to be found, nothing else could be expected than that in
the hour of victory no quarter should be given to the
murderous foe. It is as unfair as it is ridiculous to talk of the
"slaughter" of natives who, having come with arms in their
hands, not only to kill you, but your wife and child also, find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
they have reckoned without their host, and are themselves
discomfited and shot down by their would-be victims. Now,
possibly, there might be found in England a philanthropist so
meek and good that, were he suddenly confronted by a burglar
who told him plainly that he meant to kill him and walk
into his house, he would reply, although he carried a loaded
revolver in his hand, "Kill me and walk on, for it would be
against my creed and conscience to sully my hands with the
slaughter of so fine a specimen of the human race as yourself."
I do not say that so noble a character really exists
within the four seas of Britain, but if he does, I suppose he
ought to be looked for amongst the ranks of those who have
been loudest in their condemnation of the British settlers in
Rhodesia, and who thereby arrogate to themselves the possession
of a nobility of nature to which ordinary mortals cannot
hope to attain. For the sake of example, therefore, let us
say that such a man does exist, and that he is none other
than the editor of <i>Truth</i>, Mr. Henry Labouchere. Well,
granted then that Mr. Labouchere—the man whom, for the
sake of example, I have endowed with such a noble nature—would
be prompted to sacrifice his own life rather than sully
his soul with the killing of a burglar, would he go yet farther
and still spare the robber's life if he knew that, after he himself
had been killed, his wife and child would also be put to
death? I cannot believe that he would, but imagine rather
that he would shoot as straight as possible to prevent such a
catastrophe, and I for one would wish that in such a special
case his practice might be better than his usual preaching.</p>

<p class="i1">Now the settlers in Rhodesia, on those occasions when
they have been accused of slaughtering the natives, have only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
taken the same course as I think would have been adopted
by the great-souled philanthropist, whom I hope I am not
wronging by imagining that he would steel his heart to take
the life of a burglar, if for no other reason than to save the
lives of those dear to him; and therefore I would ask my
readers not to judge too harshly of the deeds of the colonists
which I have recounted in the following pages, but to remember,
when judging of their actions, the terrible provocation
which they had received. It may be that I have here and
there shown a very strong racial feeling against the black
man; but it must be remembered that my story has been
written in the midst of all the horrors of a native rebellion,
that I have seen many gruesome sights, and have with my
own hands collected together the broken skulls of murdered
women and children—Dutch and English—in order to give
them Christian burial. Thus I have sometimes written under
the influence of strong emotions, making too little allowance
possibly for the black man smarting under what he perhaps
had some reason to consider the arrogance and injustice of his
white conquerors. However, my opinions after all are of
little value, being those of a single individual; but I trust
that whoever may take the trouble to read my narrative
will accept my facts, and believe that the account I have
written of events which have lately occurred in Matabeleland
is a true and unvarnished one.</p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span>, in the end of December 1893, immediately after the
close of the first Matabele War, I rode away from Bulawayo
and set out on my journey to England, I thought it more than
probable that I should never again revisit the land over which
Lo Bengula had so lately held sway. Destiny, however, willed
it otherwise. Perhaps I found that the definition of "enough"
as "a little more than you've got," when applied to income,
was a true one; or perhaps I thought the ways of civilisation
somewhat irksome, and at times pined for "a breath of the
veld" and one more look at the wild game in the wild
country where I had already passed so many years of my
life. At any rate, when I was asked by my old friend, Mr.
Maurice Heany, to go out once more to Matabeleland to
assist him in the management of a land and gold-mining
company which he had recently floated, I gave the proposal
my very serious consideration, and when I found that my
wife was quite willing to face all the troubles and difficulties
incidental to a life in a new country, I agreed to undertake
the duties required of me for a period of two years.</p>

<p class="i1">We—my wife and I—left England for South Africa on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
30th March 1895, but we did not reach Bulawayo until the
end of the following August; as, after landing at Cape
Town, we spent two months in the Cape Colony and the
Orange Free State, and then taking ship round the coast to
Beira, proceeded by river steamer to Fontesvilla, and thence
by rail to Chimoio. Here my waggon was awaiting us, and
in it we travelled slowly and comfortably for two months,
keeping the main transport road—which I had myself laid out
four years before—to Salisbury, but from there going across
country to my old hunting camp on the Hanyani river;
thence to Hartley Hills on the Umfuli, and from there along
the old hunters' road to Bulawayo. On this portion of our
route I found game very plentiful, especially sable antelopes,
large herds of which beautiful animals I saw almost daily.
Near the river Sewhoi-whoi I was able to take my wife quite
close up to the largest herd of these antelopes that I have
ever seen. As they cantered past us within a hundred yards
I counted them roughly and made their number between
seventy-five and eighty. Having plenty of meat at the
waggon I had no need to shoot; so we just sat on our horses
and admired them, though there was one cow with a beautiful
curved pair of horns that tempted me sorely. On several
occasions we saw the fresh spoor of lions, but we never either
got a sight of the animals themselves or even heard one roar.
At the Sebakwe river I saw the tracks of a herd of elephants
that had passed only a few days before; and on this same
day I met with rather a curious experience, which, although
I am not writing an article on shooting incidents, I will
take the liberty to relate.</p>

    <span class="sc">Adventure with a Leopard.</span><br />
    "It was close to me before I could even swing my rifle over the horse's neck."
  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Early on the morning of the day in question I had left
the waggon and ridden down to the river—the Sebakwe—intending
to follow its course to the point at which the
road crossed it. Having plenty of meat, I took no native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
attendants with me, and resolved not to shoot at anything
but a small antelope, a wild pig, or some animal the greater
part of which I could have carried behind my saddle. However,
I saw no game at all, large or small, with the exception
of one reed buck ram bounding through the long grass, and
was approaching the ford across the river without having
fired a shot, when I noticed what I took to be a jackal
sitting on its haunches in the grass about a hundred and
fifty yards to my right. The grass being rather long I could
not make out very well what it was even from my horse's back,
and when I had dismounted I could barely see that there
was anything there at all. However, aiming rather low in
the grass, I fired, and distinctly heard the bullet strike something
with a loud thud. Remounting my horse, and marking
by a small bush the spot near which the now invisible
animal had been before I fired, I rode leisurely up to see
what I had shot. I was carrying my rifle across the saddle
in front of me, without having reloaded it, and on nearing
the bush I had marked pulled up my horse and was looking
about for a jackal lying dead on the ground. However
I could not see one, and was wondering how such a small
animal could have moved away after being hit by an expanding
bullet, when a loud grunting noise made me look up,
and I saw a leopard rushing towards me through the grass.
As it only charged from a distance of fifteen yards, it was
close to me before I could even swing my rifle over the
horse's neck, and I made sure that it would spring upon
him and bite and claw him badly before I could load and
shoot. However, strange to say, it simply galloped past,
almost, if not quite, brushing against my horse's fore-leg,
and passing beneath my right stirrup. After going about
thirty yards it stopped and sat down on its haunches. By
this time I had another cartridge in my rifle; so I hastily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
dismounted and gave the leopard a shot behind the shoulder,
killing it instantly. It proved to be a large female in good
condition, with a beautifully-marked skin. The first bullet
had struck it in the middle of the body, and going right
through, had made a large hole on the further side, out of
which a portion of the liver was protruding. This was of
course sufficient to account for the animal's display of bad
temper; but why it simply rushed past me without springing
on to the horse, I don't quite know. Had my horse
turned, possibly it would have done so; but being an animal
of a very imperturbable temper he never moved, and his immobility
may have disconcerted the leopard, and caused it not
to act quite up to its original intention. After disembowelling
it, I lifted it on to my horse, and carried it behind
the saddle to the ford across the Sebakwe, where I found my
waggon outspanned. This very mild adventure is the only
incident of interest which I have to record as having occurred
on our journey to Bulawayo, which we finally reached on
20th August.</p>

<p class="i1">When just twenty months previously I had left Matabeleland,
there was no other Bulawayo save a ruined kraal,
but lately wrecked and destroyed by the order of the unhappy
Lo Bengula, who in despair at the defeat of his bravest
regiments, had blown up his European house, burnt his chief
town to ashes, and abandoning the land won by his father's
assegais to the victorious troopers of the Chartered Company,
fled away to die heart-broken in the forests to the north.
Just across the stream which runs below the kraal stood the
camp of the white invaders, a rough, hardy lot of men, whom
some have called heroes and others filibusters; a confusion of
titles equally applicable, I fancy, to the followers of Drake or
Clive or any other body of men who have helped to make the
British Empire what it is. The site of the new township had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
indeed been marked out, but not a house of any kind stood
upon it. In the short interval, however, a European town
had sprung up, containing many good, substantial buildings,
whilst the bustle and movement in the dusty streets gave an
air of life and vigour to the new Bulawayo, which is very
commonly absent from the frontier towns of South Africa.
In short, at this time—the autumn of 1895—everything
was apparently <i>couleur de rose</i> in Matabeleland. Properties,
whether farm lands, building sites in town, or mining claims,
went up to very high values, whilst almost every one believed
that within a year Bulawayo would contain a population of
5000 souls, and that the town itself would receive a plentiful
supply of water from the reservoirs already in course of
construction, and be lighted by the electric light. In fact, all
was mirth and joy and hope in the future; for what was to
hinder the ever-increasing prosperity of the country? Much
good work had already been done on many of the reefs, and
on the whole the promise was distinctly good. Then again,
after a probation of eighteen months, the country had been
pronounced favourably upon by Dutch and Colonial farmers,
especially for cattle-ranching, whilst many predicted that much
of the high veld would carry sheep.</p>

<p class="i1">Apparently no difficulties with the natives were to be
apprehended, and certainly were not foreseen, as no one could
have recognised the identity in the quiet submissive native
carrying nothing but a stick, to the arrogant savage of old
times who was seldom seen without his shield and assegais,
and who was usually insolent and brutal in his manner to the
white man. No one dreamt that within a very few months
the country would be well-nigh overwhelmed in calamity;
that that terrible scourge the rinderpest, which has swept
like a destroying angel from Masailand through Central and
Eastern Africa, almost annihilating in its course all bovine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
animals as well as all the various and beautiful species of
antelopes, was creeping ever nearer to the Zambesi river, and
was destined ere long to cross that boundary, and travelling
ever southwards destroy tens of thousands of cattle in
Matabeleland, thereby paralysing its transport service, and
rendering the cost of living almost prohibitive in a country
separated by 600 miles of wilderness from the nearest railway
station. Still less, looking at the submissive behaviour of
the natives, did any one picture to himself in the furthest
recesses of his mind, the vision of homesteads burned to ashes
throughout Matabeleland, and around them the corpses of
their owners, among them many women and tender children,
all brutally murdered, lying unburied in their blood. Yet
were these dire disasters, with partial drought and plague
of locusts superadded, soon to crush all joy out of Matabeleland.</p>

<p class="i1">In spite of its air of prosperity and the light-heartedness
of its inhabitants, Bulawayo with its constant dust-storms,
scarcity of water, and general burnt-up appearance, had but
few attractions either for my wife or myself, and we made
our arrangements to get away to our Company's property of
Essexvale as soon as possible. On this property a rough
two-roomed house of poles, plastered with mud and thatched
with grass, had been got ready for us temporarily, pending
the arrival of a wire-wove bungalow that had been sent out
from England in sections, and which was to be erected on a
site chosen by myself. On our way to Essexvale we spent a
night with my old friends the missionaries at Hope Fountain,
and I had a long talk over old times, and the present condition
of the natives in Matabeleland. Mr. Helm told me that
although doubtless the members of the royal family, and the
men of position under the old regime, regretted the downfall
of their king and the conquest of the country by the white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
man, yet the great mass of the people acknowledged that they
were better off under the rule of the Chartered Company than
they had been in Lo Bengula's time; for although individual
white men were sometimes guilty of injustice and brutality
towards individual natives, yet, speaking generally, the lives
and property of the latter were now secure, and whatever
they earned was their own, all of which blessings were unknown
to them before the conquest of Matabeleland by the
white man.</p>

<p class="i1">There was, however, one matter, Mr. Helm informed me,
that was causing a great deal of discontent throughout the
country. This was the periodical taking away of the cattle
in small numbers by the Chartered Company, subsequent to
the first confiscation immediately after the war. Probably if,
after the subjugation of the country, the Chartered Company
had at once taken all the cattle they ever intended to take,
and given the natives the balance for their very own to do
with as they liked, there never would have been any heart-burning
over the cattle question at all. However, after the
first confiscation, all the remaining cattle in the country—about
90,000—were branded with the Company's brand and
left with the natives to look after. They were told that the
Company would take more from time to time as they required
them, but at the same time they were given to understand
that only cattle which had belonged to the king would be
confiscated, and none belonging to private owners interfered
with. This promise was made under the belief that nearly
all the cattle in Matabeleland had belonged to the king, and
that the private owners had been but few in number. That
this was a mistake I think there can be little doubt, as
almost every man of any standing in Matabeleland had been
a cattle-owner, some of the chief Indunas possessing large
herds of private cattle. But when a native commissioner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
received an order from the Government to send to Bulawayo
without delay a certain number of cattle from his district, he
never could have done so had he listened to all the claims
made to private ownership previous to the war, some of which
were true, but others false; and he therefore had to use his
own discretion in selecting the cattle necessary to make up
the total required. In this way certain natives suffered
wrong, more especially owners of perhaps only three or four
cows, who in some cases lost their all, both in cattle and faith
in the honesty and justice of the Government of the Chartered
Company, which they deemed had broken the promise given
to them, as indeed was the case, though the mistake was
made inadvertently and through not considering the investigation
of the whole question of sufficient importance to
take any great trouble about.</p>

<p class="i1">"If," said Mr. Helm, "the Company would take, once for
all, all the cattle they intend taking, and give the natives
the remainder, it would restore their confidence, as they now
believe that the cattle will be constantly taken away from
them in small lots until there are none left to them. However,"
he continued, "the Company can do what it likes with
them, and treat them generously or otherwise as it pleases,
for they acknowledge themselves to be a conquered people,
and will submit to any terms imposed upon them." This
remark was made by a man who had lived in close intimacy
with the natives of Matabeleland for twenty years, but as
subsequent events show, it was far from the truth. Shortly
after this conversation, the Government of the Chartered
Company, acting on the advice I believe of the chief native
commissioner, Mr. Herbert Taylor, decided to finally settle the
cattle question. There were at this time about 70,000 head of
cattle in the hands of the natives, and of this number the
Government determined to take two-fifths, leaving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
remaining three-fifths as the absolute property of the
Matabele. A meeting was called at Bulawayo, at which all
the chief Indunas in the country were present, and when the
proposition was laid before them, they expressed themselves
as thoroughly satisfied, and assured Mr. Taylor that their
people would also be satisfied; and from my own subsequent
observation, I believe that this final distribution of the cattle
caused a general feeling of relief throughout the country, and,
in the district in which I was living at any rate, the people
seemed well contented with this settlement of the question,
which left them for the most part fairly well off.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Of</span> our life on Essexvale I have but little of interest to
relate. In September and October the weather became
intensely hot, but our well-thatched house we found to be
much cooler than any building in Bulawayo, to which seat
of light and learning we paid but occasional visits. Our
wire-wove house did not arrive in Matabeleland until late in
November, just as the rainy season was setting in, and it was
not until towards the end of the year that it was put together
and stood ready to receive us, on the site I had chosen for
it. This was a very picturesque position on the top of a
cliff about eighty feet above the Ingnaima river. Here we
lived happily and contentedly for three months, and were
apparently on the most friendly terms with all the natives
living near us. Our Company bought about 1200 head of
cattle, and these I distributed amongst the natives living on
Essexvale—an estate of nearly 200,000 acres—to herd for us
in lots of from ten to thirty in number, which they were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
glad to do for the sake of the milk. To all the headmen
living immediately round the homestead I gave a larger proportion
of milk cows, on the condition that they brought me
daily half the milk.</p>

    <span class="sc">The Author's Homestead on Essexvale, Matabeleland.</span><br />
	Destroyed by the natives in April 1896.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">I was assisted in the management of the estate by a young
German, Herr Blöcker, who had taken his diplomas in a
German School of Forestry, as it was part of our Company's
scheme to start a plantation of gum trees, the timber of which
is valuable for mining purposes. We therefore cleared and
ploughed up about forty acres of land, and planted out over
5000 trees raised from seed on a strip of eight acres near the
house. The rest of the ploughed land we sowed with maize,
reserving about an acre near the river for a vegetable garden.
The ground round the house my wife laid out in flower-beds,
and I had also beds prepared for the planting of orange and
other fruit trees, which I had ordered from the Cape Colony;
whilst several banana and grenadilla plants, which had been
given us by the Rev. Mr. Helm, were already growing well.
Altogether, in spite of the most unseasonable drought which
prevailed during January, February, and March, our homestead
commenced to look quite pretty, and another year's
work would have made a nice place of it; whilst the view
from our front door up the river, with our cattle and horses
grazing on the banks, and ducks and geese swimming in
the pools or sunning themselves on the sand, was always
singularly homelike.</p>

<p class="i1">As I have said above, up to the day of the native insurrection,
which broke out towards the end of March, all the
natives on Essexvale appeared to be on the most friendly
terms with us, and were always most civil and polite to my
wife, who had grown to like them very much. We had done
them many good turns, and I believe they liked us as individuals.
Umlugulu, a relation of Lo Bengula's, and one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the principal men in that king's time, as well as a high priest
of the ceremonies at the annual religious dance of the Inxwala,
was living about fifteen miles away, and often came to
see us. He was a very gentle-mannered savage, and always
most courteous and polite in his bearing, and by us he was
always treated with the consideration due to one who had
held a high position and been a man of importance in Lo
Bengula's time. It is now supposed, and I think with justice,
that this man was one of the chief instigators of the rebellion;
but if this is so, I have strong reasons for believing that he
only finally made up his mind that the time had come for
the attempt to be made to drive the white men out of the
country when he learnt that the whole of the police force of
Matabeleland, together with the artillery, munitions of war,
etc., which had been taken down to the Transvaal by Dr.
Jameson, had been captured by the Boers. My reason for
thinking so is, that before he heard this news he asked me
several times to take some unbranded cattle from him, and
have them herded amongst my own, or bought from him at
my own price. This request I could not grant, but advised
him to go and tell Dr. Jameson the story he had told me, as
to how these cattle came to be in his possession without the
Company's brand on them. After he heard the news of Dr.
Jameson's surrender, Umlugulu never said anything more
about these cattle, but he often came to see me, and always
questioned me very closely as to what had actually happened
in the Transvaal. Although at that time I had no idea as
to the lines on which I now think his mind was working, I
gave him little or no information, the more so that I could
see he was very anxious to get at the truth.</p>

<p class="i1">Towards the end of February, Mr. Jackson, the native
commissioner in my district, who was living with a sub-inspector
and a force of native police at a spot on one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
roads through Essexvale about twelve miles distant from our
house, informed me that rumours of coming disaster to the
white man, purporting to emanate from the "Umlimo" or
god of the Makalakas, who dwells in a cave of the Matopo
Hills, were being spread abroad amongst the people of Matabeleland.
Shortly before this there had been a total eclipse
of the moon. This the Umlimo told the natives meant that
white man's blood was about to be spilt. Further than this,
they were informed that Lo Bengula was not dead, but was
now on his way back to Matabeleland with a large army from
the north, whilst two other armies were coming to help him
against the white man from the west and east. "Watch the
coming moon," said the Umlimo, "and be ready." He also
claimed to have sent the rinderpest, which had just reached
the cattle in the north of Matabeleland—though of what
advantage that scourge was to the natives I don't quite see—and
promised that he would soon afflict the white men themselves
with some equally terrible disease.</p>

<p class="i1">Now, although these rumours of a native rising were
current in Matabeleland some time before the insurrection
actually broke out, and were reported to the then acting
chief native commissioner, Mr. Thomas, and to the heads of
the Government, I do not think that they would have been
warranted in taking any steps of a suppressive nature at this
juncture; for there was absolutely nothing tangible to go
upon, nor could any commission of inquiry have come to
any other conclusion than that the natives had no intention
of rebelling; for they were as quiet and submissive in their
demeanour towards Europeans as they ever had been since
the war, and there was absolutely no evidence of any secret
arming amongst them; and the fact remains that, with one
exception, all those Europeans in Matabeleland who had had
a long experience of natives—that is, the native commissioners, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
missionaries, and a few old traders and hunters,
amongst whom I must include myself—were unanimous in the
opinion that no rebellion on the part of the Matabele was to
be apprehended. I say there was one exception, as I have
been told that Mr. Usher, an old trader long resident in
Matabeleland, and who since the first war has been living
altogether amongst the natives, has always maintained that
the Matabele would one day rise against the white man.</p>

<p class="i1">For myself, I had many conversations with Mr. Jackson
on the subject, and we came to the conclusion, after talking
with several intelligent natives regarding the rumours going
about, that the Matabele were not likely to rebel until Lo
Bengula appeared with his army. "However," said Mr.
Jackson one evening, "it is very difficult to worm a secret
out of a native, and if there should be an insurrection those
are the devils we have to fear," pointing to his squad of
native Matabele policemen, sitting about round their huts all
armed with repeating Winchester rifles. At that time no one
would have imagined that these native policemen—all fine,
active-looking young fellows, and very smart at their drill—would
have been likely to mutiny, since they were not only
very well disciplined but most civil and obedient to their
white officers; whilst, on the other hand, they were constantly
at loggerheads with their compatriots, whom they had to
bring to book for any transgression of the Chartered
Company's laws, and more particularly for evasion of the
regulations exacting a certain amount of labour annually at
a fixed rate of pay from every able-bodied young man. However,
as subsequent events have shown, Mr. Jackson was right
in his prognostication, for when the rebellion did break out,
about half the native police at once turned their rifles against
their employers. The remainder were true to their salt, but
had to be disarmed as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">I will now before going further say a word concerning the
"Umlimo" or god of the Makalakas, who has apparently
played such an important part in the present rebellion, but
who, I think, has in reality only been the instrument employed
by the actual leaders of the insurrection to work upon the
superstitions of the people, and mould them to their will. To
the best of my belief, there exists amongst the Makalakas, as
amongst all the tribes of allied race throughout South-Eastern
Africa, an hereditary priesthood, confined to one family, though
from time to time certain other young men are adopted by
the high priest and initiated into the mysteries of his profession.
These men in common with the actual sons of the
high priest are known henceforth as children of the god.
The head of the family lives in the Matopo Hills, and is
known as the Umlimo, but as far as one can understand
from the rather conflicting statements made concerning him
by the natives, he is not actually the Umlimo, but a being
possessed of all the ordinary attributes of man,—in fact a
human being, with a spiritual nature superadded which
enables him to commune with the unseen Deity that pervades
space, and communicate the wishes or commands of
the invisible spirit to the people. The temple of the
Umlimo is a cave in the Matopo Hills, whither the people
repair to consult him; and I believe that the voice which is
heard in answer to their questions from the depths of the
cave is supposed to emanate not from the human Umlimo
or priest, but to be the actual utterance of the invisible god.
The human Umlimo is kept wonderfully well posted up concerning
everything that happens in Matabeleland, probably
by the various members of his family, who live in different
parts of the country, and who often visit him. He is thus
often enabled to make very shrewd answers to the questions
asked him, and to show himself conversant with matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
which his interlocutors thought were known only to themselves;
and in this way he has gained a great ascendency over
the minds of the people.</p>

<p class="i1">If one asks who the Umlimo is, the answer is that he is
a spirit or supernatural being of infinite wisdom, known to
man only as a voice speaking from the depths of a cave. He
is said to be able to speak all languages, as well as to be
possessed of the faculty of roaring like a lion, crowing like a
cock, barking like a dog, etc. On the other hand, the human
Umlimo accepts or rather demands presents from those
who visit his cave for the purpose of consulting the Deity,
and possesses not only cattle, sheep, and goats, but also a
large number of wives. The great mass of the Matabele
people seem to me to have very vague ideas concerning the
Umlimo; and sometimes I think that besides the priest in
the Matopos through whom the voice of God is supposed to
be heard, there are other priests,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or so-called Umlimos, in
other parts of the country through whom they believe that
the commands of the Almighty can be conveyed to them.
At any rate, both prior to and during the present rebellion,
utterances purporting to emanate from the "Umlimo" have
been implicitly believed in, and the commands attributed to
him obeyed with a blind fanaticism, that one would not have
looked for in a people who always seem to be extremely
matter of fact and practical in everyday life. It may seem
strange that this "Umlimo," or god of the despised Makalakas,
should be accepted as an oracle by the Matabele, but I know
that Lo Bengula professed a strong belief in his magical
powers, and from time to time consulted him. I believe,
however, that the Umlimo was made use of for the purposes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the present rebellion by Umlugulu, and other members of
the late king's family.</p>

<p class="i1">These men were naturally not content with their position
under the white man's rule, and as ever since the war they
had probably been rebels at heart, they only wanted an
opportunity to call the people to arms. This opportunity
they thought had come when they heard that the entire
police force of Matabeleland, together with most of the big
guns and munitions of war up till then stored in Bulawayo,
had been captured by the Boers. For to them the police
represented the fighting or military element amongst the
white men, and they more or less despised all other classes,
whom they usually saw going about altogether unarmed and
defenceless. When the police were gone, therefore, they at
once probably set about stirring up a rebellion, and got the
Umlimo to play their game and work upon the superstitions
of the people. This at any rate is my own opinion of the
origin of the insurrection.</p>

<p class="i1">About the middle of March I was appointed cattle inspector
for the district between the Umzingwani and Insiza
rivers, and had to do a lot of riding about in my endeavours
to assist the Government to arrest the spread of the rinderpest.
However, one might as well have tried to stop a rising
tide on the sea-shore, as prevent this dreadful disease from
travelling steadily down the main roads, leaving nothing but
rotting carcasses and ruined men behind it. Therefore, while
still strictly prohibiting all movement of cattle from infected
districts to parts of the country yet free from the terrible
scourge, the Government declared the main roads open for
traffic on Tuesday, 24th March, in order that as many waggon-loads
of provisions as possible might be brought into Bulawayo,
whilst any oxen were still left alive to pull them; for at this
time the only calamities apprehended in Matabeleland were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
famine, and the complete dislocation of transport throughout
the country owing to the terrible mortality amongst the cattle
from rinderpest. These dangers indeed seemed so pressing
that the Government was called upon by a deputation from
the Chamber of Commerce to at once purchase 2000 mules,
to be used for the importation of food-stuffs into Bulawayo,
and their distribution from that centre to the various mining
districts.</p>

<p class="i1">On Sunday, 22nd March, I reached Bulawayo late in
the evening, after a very long day's ride inspecting cattle,
and I then heard rumours of a disturbance having taken place
between some of Mr. Jackson's native police and the inhabitants
of a Matabele kraal near the north-western boundary
of our Company's property of Essexvale. On the following
day I got a fresh horse and rode twenty-five miles down the
Tuli road to Dawson's store on the Umzingwani river—the
limit of my beat in this direction—issuing passes to all the
waggons I met with to proceed on their way up or down the
road on the following morning. Arrived at the store, I there
met my friend Mr. Jackson, the native commissioner, and
Mr. Cooke, and learned from them that a native policeman
had been murdered by the Matabele on the previous Friday
night, and that the murderers had fled into the Matopo Hills,
taking all their women and children as well as their cattle
with them. My friends were only waiting for a detachment
of native police, under two white inspectors, to follow up the
murderers and endeavour to bring them to justice.</p>

are the white police?—Native woman gives information of the murder
of whites—Natives run off with the cattle—Murder of three miners—Inscrutability
of the Kafir mind—Matabele raid on cattle.</p>


<p><span class="sc">Now</span> this murder of a native policeman on the night of
Friday, 20th March, was the first overt act of rebellion on the
part of the Matabele against the Government of the British
South Africa Company, and I will therefore relate exactly
what occurred. On the evening of the aforementioned day,
eight native policemen, acting on instructions of Mr. Jackson,
arrived at the town of Umgorshlwini, situated in the hills
near the Umzingwani river. Being accompanied by several
boys carrying their blankets, etc., they formed quite a little
party, and so camped outside the native town. They were
sitting talking over their fires after the evening meal, when a
number of Matabele came up, and ranging themselves in a
line in front of them, commenced to dance. These men all
carried knob-kerries, and were led by a man named Umzobo,
<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
who had held a post of importance at Bulawayo in Lo
Bengula's time. The so-called dancing of all Kafirs of Zulu
race is not dancing in the European sense, but consists for
the most part in stamping on the ground, swaying the body
and gesticulating with sticks. The stamping is usually
accompanied by a chant, the words of which are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
improvised for the occasion, and the effect of the whole
dance is decidedly stimulating, as I have often watched a
stolid, stupid-looking Kafir work himself up to a state of high
excitability by this means. On the present occasion Umzobo
and his men very soon showed that they had come to dance
before the representatives of the law with a purpose, that
purpose being to pick a quarrel with them. They soon
commenced to "jia," or point with their sticks; then one of
them ran out of the line, and coming close up to the police,
stooped forward, and drawing his left hand rapidly backwards
and forwards across his throat, said: "You are killing us, you
are killing us; why don't you cut our throats, and make an
end of it?" Then another ran out, and repeating the formula,
"you are killing us," pressed his finger on his temple, and
said: "Why don't you shoot us? why don't you put the bullet
in just here?" The expression, "you're killing us," so frequently
used by Umzobo's men, meant "you're making life
unpleasant to us by enforcing the Company's laws."</p>

<p class="i1">When these hostile demonstrations had gone on for some
time, the sergeant in charge of the police told Umzobo that
he had better take his men away, and tell them to go to
sleep, as nobody wanted to fight with them; but his words
were without effect, and the dancing was still going on,
when one of the policemen saw a man creeping stealthily
towards them round the back of the cattle kraal. At once
suspecting mischief, he jumped up, and calling to his comrades
"Look out, we're amongst enemies," rushed upon the crouching
figure that at once stood up and revealed a Kafir armed
with an assegai. Before he could make use of his weapon,
however, the policeman caught him by the wrist, whilst
another guardian of the law who had followed close behind
seized his other arm. They at once disarmed the man, and were
putting the handcuffs on him, when a shot was fired out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the cattle kraal, aimed of course at the police, but so badly
aimed that instead of hitting one of them, it struck their
prisoner in the back, killing him almost instantly. Indeed,
he fell dead with the handcuff on one wrist. Immediately
the shot was fired some of the police rushed into the kraal
and almost succeeded in capturing the man who had fired, so
nearly in fact that he dropped his rifle in his hurry to
escape.</p>

<p class="i1">Umzobo and his men had now disappeared, and the
police having collected together, were standing in the light
of their camp fires uncertain what to do, when a volley was
fired amongst them from the bush outside the kraal. None
of the police were hit, but one of their blanket-carriers was shot
through the head and killed on the spot. Not knowing the
number of their unseen enemies, the representatives of the law
then thought it advisable to beat a retreat. They reached Mr.
Jackson's camp at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on Saturday, handing him the
captured rifle, and reporting the loss of two of their boys; for
besides the one whom they knew to be dead, another small
boy some ten or twelve years of age was missing. This boy
Mr. Jackson found lying dead half under the kraal fence, when
he visited Umgorshlwini with all the police he could muster
on the morning after the disturbance. The town was then
deserted, and Mr. Jackson thinks that this small boy must
have been discovered trying to hide under the fence after the
police had left. He had been murdered in a most brutal
way, his skull having been smashed to atoms with knob-kerries.</p>

<p class="i1">But the murder of these two police boys and the accidental
killing of one of Umzobo's men was not the only deed
of blood which occurred on this Friday night. Amongst
Umzobo's men was one Ganyana. After the retreat of the
police this man went alone to the kraal of a nephew of Lo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Bengula—Umfondisi, the son of Lo Magazi—and waking him
up, told him what had happened. According to the report
of a stranger who was sleeping in Umfondisi's kraal that
night, Ganyana was very much excited and called out,
"Come, Umfondisi; why are you sleeping? don't you know
we're fighting? we've killed some policemen, come; blood is
running and men are lying dead; come with me and let us
do some more killing." Umfondisi was nothing loth, and
arming himself with an assegai went off with Ganyana to a
neighbouring kraal, the headman of which they at once
awakened in order to tell him the news. At this kraal there
happened to be one of Mr. Jackson's native policemen. He
was asleep in a hut when Ganyana and Umfondisi arrived, but
the loud and excited conversation that was being carried on
awoke him, and he got up and came out of the hut, asking as
he did so what all the noise was about. "Who are you?"
said Ganyana. "I am so and so, one of Mr. Jackson's policemen,"
was the answer. "What!" responded Ganyana; "do
you tell me that you are one of the witches who are always
troubling us?" and running up to him he shot him, and as
he fell down mortally wounded, Umfondisi, the king's
nephew, plunged his assegai into him.</p>

<p class="i1">When on Monday evening, 23rd March, I heard from Mr.
Jackson what had happened on the previous Friday night, I
imagined that the disturbance was merely the outcome of
local discontent, and little thought that this attack on native
policemen was but the prelude to the most terrible massacre
of Europeans that has ever yet taken place in a native rising in
South Africa; and more than this, that even whilst I listened
to the story, white men, women, and children lay freshly
murdered not many miles away. On the following morning,
Tuesday, 24th March, I rode through the hills to my own
place, passing Umgorshlwini on the way. Riding round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the kraal I found bloodstains where the three men had been
killed, but the bodies had been taken away and buried by
the order of Mr. Jackson. The kraal itself, together with
many smaller ones in its vicinity, was absolutely deserted,
and a splendid crop of corn left standing in the valley
below.</p>

<p class="i1">Having been absent since the previous Sunday morning,
I was still all unsuspicious of danger, but knowing now all
that actually happened during that time within a short
distance of my house, I shudder to think of what might
have occurred there during my absence; for my wife had
been quite alone in the house with two little native girls;
Mr. Blöcker, my German assistant, and a young Scotchman,
Mr. Notman, occupying huts some distance away.</p>

<p class="i1">I reached home about mid-day, and found everything
going on as usual. My wife told me that during the morning
several men—all of whom I knew well—had come over to
see her from the chief village of the district—Intuntini—which
had been a big military kraal before the war. These
men were all true-blooded Matabele, and several of them were
in charge of cattle belonging to my Company. They all
wished to borrow axes from her, to be used for the purpose of
strengthening their cattle kraals, they said, but I know now
that they wanted them as weapons of offence, as many of the
murders were committed with axes. As we were accustomed
to assist the natives in any small matter of this kind, she let
them have all the axes that could be spared, and allowed
them to sharpen them on the grindstone. About sundown
some of these same men brought the usual evening's milk,
and my wife and I chatted with them for some time. We
spoke about the recent murders on the Umzingwani, and the
conduct of Umzobo and Umfondisi, and my wife asked me to
say that she thought they had acted very foolishly, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
white men would punish them. At this they laughed, and
one of them said significantly, "How can the white men
punish them? where are the white police? there are none left
in the country."</p>

<p class="i1">Soon after these men had left us, George, a colonial Kafir
in my employ, came and said he wished to speak to me, and
on my going aside with him informed me that his wife—a
Matabele woman—had just heard from another native woman
that white men had been murdered on the previous day by
the Matabele, on the further side of the Malungwani range,
amongst them a native commissioner, who, it was said, had
had his throat cut by his own black police. On hearing this
disagreeable news, which I did not doubt was substantially
true, I began to think that we were going to have a native
rising after all. However, I did not consider that we were in
any danger, except from natives coming from a distance, as I
could not believe that any of the people living close round
us would be keen to murder either my wife or myself or
any one living with us, as we had benefited them in many
ways, and had certainly never given them any cause to dislike
our presence amongst them. I, of course, said nothing
to my wife as to what I had heard, but I told Mr. Blöcker
and the young Scotchman to keep their rifles handy in case
of accidents. I had, too, some very good watch-dogs that I
knew would give me warning if any Kafirs came near the
house, and I kept awake all night with my rifle and a belt
full of cartridges alongside of me. But the night passed off
quite quietly.</p>

<p class="i1">Why no attempt was made to murder us on that Tuesday
night will always remain a mystery to me. I should like to
think that because we had always treated them kindly and
considerately, our immediate neighbours shrank from killing
us; but after all that has happened I find it very difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
believe this. They may have come with the intention of
killing us on the Tuesday morning, but finding me absent,
and Mr. Blöcker with a rifle in his hands—for when they
arrived at the homestead he was just going off to shoot a cow
whose hip had been dislocated in branding—may not have
thought the opportunity a good one. My wife noticed that
they seemed very excited, and they also seemed very anxious
to know when I would return.</p>

<p class="i1">All things considered, I am afraid we owe them little, as
if they did not attempt to murder us they at any rate gave us
no warning, and went off on the Tuesday night with all the
cattle I had entrusted to their care, and in all likelihood
assisted in the murder of Messrs. Foster, Eagleson, and
Anderson, all three of whom were carrying on mining work
on Essexvale; Foster's camp being within four miles of my
home.</p>

<p class="i1">The events of the last three months have taught me at
least this, that it is impossible for a European to understand
the workings of a native's mind; and, speaking personally,
after having spent over twenty years of my life amongst the
Kafirs, I now see that I know nothing about them, and
recognise that I am quite incompetent to express an opinion
as to the line of conduct they would be likely to adopt under
any given circumstances.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning I got up early, and after seeing
the Kafirs make a start on the work on which I was then
engaged—which was the preparation of a piece of ground
round the house for a plantation of fruit trees—I went up to
George's hut and told him to try and get some farther particulars,
through his wife, as to the murders said to have been
committed on the previous Monday. Then I strolled back to
the house and worked at one thing and another till breakfast
time, and was just going indoors to sit down to that meal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
when I saw George running down from his hut to our house,
followed by a Kafir boy. As he came near he shouted out to
the horse-herd who was standing by the stable, "Bring the
horses, bring the horses; make haste!"</p>

<p class="i1">I knew then there was something wrong, and half thought
that an attack was imminent, and having my wife's safety to
provide for, was much relieved when George told me that no
pressing danger threatened, but that armed Kafirs had driven
off some of my Company's cattle. The boy who accompanied
George belonged to a small kraal, to the members of which I
had given some twenty or thirty head of cattle to look after
for our Company, they getting full benefit of all the milk, a
great boon to them, as they possessed no cattle of their own.
He had been sent by the headman to inform me that just at
daylight a number of Matabele from the kraal of Gwibu, a
nephew of Lo Bengula, had opened the cattle kraal and driven
off all the cattle, threatening the life of any one who interfered
with them. These men, he said, were all armed either
with guns or shields and assegais, and wore white ox-tails
round their left arms and necks. Whilst I was still speaking,
another messenger arrived to tell me that all the Intuntini
people had left in the night, taking all their cattle with them,
the greater part of which belonged to my Company. I now
knew that we were face to face with a native rising, but I
thought—what was indeed the fact—that this rising had been
fomented by members of the late king's family, and was confined
so far to the Abenzantsi, or Matabele of pure Zulu
descent, and I cherished the hope that if energetic measures
were at once adopted by the Government, the more numerous
and useful section of the nation, of Makalaka and Mashuna
descent, might be kept quiet and the rebellion speedily suppressed.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Precautions against native attack—Conference with the neighbouring headmen—I
take my wife into Bulawayo—Insurrection reported general—Armed
forces sent to disturbed districts—Return to Essexvale with small
mounted force—Short supply of horses and rifles—My views of the Kafir
rising—The progress of the insurrection at Essexvale and the neighbourhood—Wholesale
murders.</p>


<p><span class="sc">The</span> first thing to be done was to take my wife into Bulawayo,
and then return at once with a body of armed men to
Essexvale, in order to make a display of force which might
deter those natives, who were still sitting quiet watching
events, from joining the rebels; for I knew that the general
idea was, that there being now no longer any police force in
the country, the Government was practically powerless to
cope with an organised rebellion. I therefore had all our
horses saddled up immediately to be ready for emergencies,
and in order to guard against surprise placed George as a
vidette on the top of a rise behind the house, from which a
good view of the surrounding country was obtainable. Then,
whilst we were having breakfast, I sent messengers to summon
all the headmen of the kraals in the immediate vicinity of
the homestead. These men, I may say, were all in possession
of cattle belonging to my Company, and as none of them
were pure-blooded Matabele, I imagined they would have no
sympathy with the insurgents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">They all answered my summons, accompanied by many
of their people, and before leaving I spoke to them, and did
my best to impress upon them the folly of rebelling against
the white man. They professed themselves in perfect accord
with all I said; averred that they were quite content to live
with me as their "inkosi,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and protested that they had
nothing to hope for from the overthrow of the white man by
the Matabele. In conclusion, I told them that I was going
into Bulawayo to place my wife in a position of safety, but
that I would return immediately with an armed force and
endeavour to recover some of the cattle stolen by Gwibu and
the rest of the Matabele. Mr. Blöcker wished to remain at
the homestead until my return, but this I would not allow,
as I did not care to leave a white man all by himself; and
besides I required him to help me in getting some men
together. George—the colonial Kafir—however, stopped
behind, as he considered himself quite safe with Umsetchi's
people,—Umsetchi being the headman of several little kraals
close to the house, with the inhabitants of which we had
always been on the most friendly terms.</p>

<p class="i1">Our ride into Bulawayo was altogether uneventful, as our
road lay almost entirely through uninhabited country, and
did not cross the line that the rebel natives of the district
would have been likely to take on their way to the fastnesses
of the Malungwani Hills. As, however, it was a scorching
hot day it was a very trying experience for my wife.</p>

<p class="i1">Just before reaching town we met Mr. Claude Grenfell,
who, with Messrs. Norton and Edmonds, was on his way out
to Essexvale with a cart and horses to bring in my wife, and
from them we learned that the insurrection was becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
general all over the country, and that forces had already been
raised and sent out to relieve miners and settlers in the outlying
districts. The Hon. Maurice Gifford had left the
previous day for the Insiza, whilst Messrs. Napier and
Spreckley were just on the point of starting for other disturbed
parts of the country.</p>

<p class="i1">After handing over my wife to the kind care of her good
friend Mrs. Spreckley, I at once set to work to get together a
mounted force with which to return immediately to Essexvale,
and thanks to the energetic assistance of Mr. Blöcker
and Mr. Norton I was able to leave Bulawayo again at
eight o'clock the same evening with thirty-six mounted men.
I had wished to raise a force of 100 men, but found it impossible
to do so, nearly all the horses and rifles in the
possession of the Government having been given out to equip
the forces already sent out before my arrival in town. There
were men enough left, and good men too, ready to go with me
anywhere, but the Government could only supply six horses—and
not good ones at that—and twenty rifles. However, I
managed to raise thirty private horses, and some private rifles,
and got away about two hours after sundown with a compact
little force of thirty-six mounted men.</p>

<p class="i1">The moon was now getting near the full, and by its light
we pushed on, and at 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on Thursday, 26th March, were
back at my homestead, which is just twenty-three miles
distant from Bulawayo. Here I found everything as I had
left it, George having installed himself with some of Umsetchi's
men in the stable, which being built very solidly of stone,
they might easily have held against any ordinary attack.</p>

<p class="i1">I had left Essexvale a few hours before, without any
very bitter feeling against the Kafirs, for after all, looking at
things from their point of view, if they thought they could
succeed in shaking off the white man's rule, and retaking all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the cattle that once were theirs or their king's, and all those
brought into the country since the war as well, why shouldn't
they try the chances of rebellion? I knew they would have
to fight to accomplish their ends, and it was for them to
consider whether the game was worth the candle or not. At
that time, however, I was far from realising what had
happened, and was inclined to judge the Kafirs very leniently.
But my visit to Bulawayo had changed my sentiments
entirely, and the accounts which I had there heard of the
cruel and treacherous murders that had been perpetrated on
defenceless women and children, besides at once destroying
whatever sympathy I may have at first felt for the rebels, had
not only filled me with indignation, but had excited a desire
for vengeance, which could only be satisfied by a personal and
active participation in the killing of the murderers. I don't
defend such feelings, nor deny that they are vile and brutal
when viewed from a high moral standpoint; only I would
say to the highly moral critic, Be charitable if you have not
yourself lived through similar experiences; be not too harsh
in your judgment of your fellow-man, for you probably know
not your own nature, nor are you capable of analysing
passions which can only be understood by those Europeans
who have lived through a native rising, in which women and
children of their race have been barbarously murdered by
savages; by beings whom, in their hearts, they despise;
as rightly or wrongly they consider that they belong to a
lower type of the human family than themselves.</p>

<p class="i1">I offer no opinion upon this sentiment, but I say that it
undoubtedly exists, and must always aggravate the savagery
of a conflict between the two races; whilst the murder of
white women and children, by natives, seems to the colonist
not merely a crime, but a sacrilege, and calls forth all the
latent ferocity of the more civilised race. For, kind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
considerate though any European may be under ordinary
circumstances to the savages amongst whom he happens to be
living, yet deep down in his heart, whether he be a miner or
a missionary, is the conviction that the black man belongs to
a lower type of humanity than the white; and if this is a
mistaken conviction, ask the negrophilist who professes to
think so, whether he would give his daughter in marriage to
a negro, and if not, why not?</p>

<p class="i1">At any rate the lovers and admirers of the Matabele
would do well to caution their protégés not to commence
another insurrection by the murder of white women and
children, for should they do so, they will once more have
cause to rue a war of retaliation, that will be waged with all
the merciless ferocity which must inevitably follow upon
such a course; as, although the murder of Europeans by
savages may commend itself to certain arm-chair philosophers
in England, who can see no good in a colonist, nor any harm
in a savage, yet the colonists themselves cannot look upon
such matters from the same point of view, and will take such
steps to prevent the recurrence of any farther ebullitions of
temper, as were taken by the United States troops after the
massacres of Minnesota, or by the British troops at
Secunderabad and other places in suppressing the Indian
Mutiny.</p>

<p class="i1">Before resuming my personal narrative, I will give a short
account of what had already taken place in the progress of
the insurrection on Essexvale itself, and in those parts of the
Insiza and Filibusi districts which border upon Essexvale.</p>

<p class="i1">There is reason to believe that the outbreak of the rebellion,
commencing as it did with the murder of a native policeman
on Friday, 20th March, was somewhat premature, and thus
there was an interval of nearly three days between the date
of this murder and the day when the first white men were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
killed by the natives. From the Umzingwani, the flame of
rebellion spread through the Filibusi and Insiza districts,
to the Tchangani and Inyati, and thence to the mining
camps in the neighbourhood of the Gwelo and Ingwenia
rivers, and indeed throughout the country wherever white
men, women, and children could be taken by surprise and
murdered either singly or in small parties; and so quickly
was this cruel work accomplished, that although it was only
on 23rd March that the first Europeans were murdered, there
is reason to believe that by the evening of the 30th not a
white man was left alive in the outlying districts of Matabeleland.
Between these two dates many people escaped or were
brought in to Bulawayo by relief parties, but a large number
were cruelly and treacherously murdered.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Not</span> far from the once large military kraal of Gorshlwayo,
near the southern border of Essexvale, was a trading station
known as Edkins' store. In the neighbourhood were several
mining camps and the residence of a native commissioner,
and it is here probably that the first murders of Europeans
were committed during the present native rising.</p>

<p class="i1">At any rate some time on Monday, 23rd March,
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> seven
white men, two colonial boys and a coolie cook were murdered
there. Among the murdered men was Mr. Bentley, the
native commissioner, who was shot or stabbed from behind,
whilst sitting in his hut writing—the date above the last words
he ever wrote being 23rd March. Mr. Edkins and three
other white men, together with their two colonial servants
and the coolie cook, were killed in and round the store,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
whilst Messrs. Ivers and Ottens were killed, the former near
the Celtic mining camp, and the latter about half-way between
the camp and the store, from which it was distant about a
mile and a half. The corpses of these poor fellows were found
by Colonel Spreckley's relief party four days subsequent to the
massacre. A colonial native was also discovered still living,
though terribly injured. He had evidently been left for dead
by the Matabele, and besides the wounds which they had
inflicted on him in order to kill him, they had slit his mouth
open from ear to ear. It was not thought that this man
could possibly live, but his wounds were dressed, and food
given him, and, wonderful to relate, he eventually made his
way to Bulawayo, where, thanks to the skilful treatment and
kind nursing he received in the hospital there, he in time
recovered from his injuries.</p>

<p class="i1">He was able to give evidence concerning the murders,
which he said were committed suddenly and without warning
by native policemen, aided by natives from the surrounding
kraals under two brothers of Lo Bengula, Maschlaschlin and
Umfaizella, who, with Umlugulu, Gwibu, Umfondisi, and
other members of the king's family, were the chief instigators
of the rebellion; and this being so, no peace can be made
that will satisfy the colonists until all the members of the
late king's family, as well as every Induna and every native
policeman who it can be proved took part in the murders
which marked the outbreak of the rebellion, have been either
hanged or shot.</p>

<p class="i1">This may seem a big order to some people—who, however,
do not probably contemplate residing on a lonely farm in
Rhodesia—but it is necessary for the future safety of the
country.</p>

<p class="i1">The bodies of Ottens and Bentley had been mutilated,
and dry grass had been heaped up and burnt over the faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of all the dead, possibly with the idea of destroying their
identity.</p>

<p class="i1">Almost simultaneously with the murders at Edkins' store,
or at any rate on the same day, the massacre of the whites
was commenced in the Insiza district, the first sufferers being
probably the Cunningham family, who were living on a farm
near the Insiza river. These poor people seem to have been
attacked early in the afternoon, as when their homestead was
visited on the following day by Messrs. Liebert and Fynn,
the remains of the mid-day meal were still on the table,
whilst old Mr. Cunningham seemed to have been murdered
whilst reclining on a couch reading a newspaper. Here is
the sworn deposition of Mr. Fynn, the assistant native commissioner
for the Insiza district, as to the finding of the
bodies.</p>

<p class="i1">Herbert Pomeroy Fynn's sworn statement:—</p>

<p class="i1">"I am an assistant native commissioner for the Insiza
district. I accompanied last witness—Mr. Liebert—and
Orpen to Cunningham's farm on Tuesday morning, 24th March.
On arrival there I saw eight dead bodies lying on the ground
about twenty yards from the homestead. We made a cursory
examination and saw that the deceased persons had been
murdered by means of knob-kerries and battle-axes, or similar
weapons. The ground was covered with native footprints,
and there were broken knob-kerries lying about. I identified
among the dead bodies those of Mr. Cunningham senior,
Mrs. Cunningham, two Miss Cunninghams, Master Cunningham,
and three children whom I identified as the grandchildren
of Mr. Cunningham senior. The deceased persons
appeared to have been killed inside the house and afterwards
dragged out and thrown outside in the position in which we
found them. From the fact that all the native kraals in the
vicinity were quite deserted, I have absolutely no doubt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the persons who killed the deceased were Matabele natives.
Young Cunningham, aged about fourteen years, was still alive
when we arrived, but unconscious, and died immediately after
our arrival."</p>

<p class="i1">Such is the bald account of the discovery of the battered
and bloody remains of this unfortunate family, which, alas!
was not the only one suddenly blotted out of existence, root
and branch, during the first terrible days of the Matabele
rebellion. The hideous barbarity of these murders, and the
feeling of intense exasperation they would be likely to
excite amongst the surviving settlers, seem to have been
somewhat underrated in England; whilst for obvious reasons
they have been carefully kept out of sight by those dishonest
speakers who recently endeavoured to excite public
opinion against the white population of Rhodesia. You
can respect an honest enemy even if you can't like
him; but when a fanatic endeavours to support either his
or her theories by the suppression of truth, he or she
becomes contemptible.</p>

<p class="i1">But we are thankful for the sympathy of that most
determined enemy of everything Rhodesian—except the noble
savages who therein dwell—Mr. Labouchere, who has professed
himself "sorry for the women and children who have
been killed." Sorry—only sorry! Wonderful indeed is the
calm serenity of soul that enables that noble nature to view all
mundane affairs from the same cold, passionless plane, whether
it be the cruel murder of an English settler's wife and family
in Rhodesia, or an accident to the wheel of a friend's bicycle in
Hyde Park! But the men who have looked upon the corpses
of the murdered ones, who have seen the shattered skulls of
their countrywomen, the long grey locks of the aged and the
sunny curls of the girls and little children all alike dabbled
in their blood, are something more than sorry; indignation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
mingles with their sorrow, and they are determined to exact
such punishment for the crimes committed, as shall preclude
as far as possible their recurrence in the future.</p>

<p class="i1">At a distance of a few miles from the Cunninghams' farm
was a mining property belonging to the Nellie Reef Development
Company, where work was being carried on under the
superintendence of Mr. Thomas Maddocks, the manager of
the Nellie Reef Mine. At about a quarter to six on the
evening of Monday, 23rd March, that is probably some four
hours after the murder of the Cunningham family, Mr.
Maddocks and two miners, Messrs. Hocking and Hosking,
were sitting smoking outside their huts just before dinner,
when some fifteen natives came up armed with knob-kerries
and battle-axes. The man who appeared to be their leader
spoke to Mr. Maddocks and said that he and his companions
had been sent by Mr. Fynn, the native commissioner, to work,
and on being asked if he had a letter from that gentleman,
called to some more natives who were standing not far off.
What followed I will tell in the words of Mr. John Hosking,
who, in his sworn statement regarding the death of Mr.
Maddocks, deposes as follows:—</p>

<p class="i1">"The call was answered by a shout of 'Tchaia,' 'strike.'
A number of natives joined those who were with us, and the
leader then struck deceased on the head with a knob-kerry.
I immediately retired into my hut for my revolver. When I
came back three natives were hitting Hocking with kerries
and axes. I fired a shot and dropped one man, and just as I
had fired my second shot, I received a blow on the head causing
the mark I now show. Hocking then managed to get into
the hut, whereupon the natives cleared off; Hocking and I
then went to Maddocks, but found him dead. We retired
into an iron store, at which the natives fired a shot. The
bullet passed inside through the iron, which caused us to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
retire again to the hut." By this time it was growing
dusk, so the two wounded miners, fearing that the natives
would soon return and fire the hut, crept out, and getting into
the long grass, made their escape to Cumming's store, three
miles from Maddocks' camp, where about twenty men had
already collected, many of whom, however, were unarmed.
A laager was at once formed, and Mr. Cumming and another
rode into Bulawayo for assistance. They first, however,
warned several miners and farmers living in the neighbourhood,
that the natives had risen, thus saving the lives of
these people, as they all got safely to the laager and ultimately
escaped to Bulawayo, whereas but for this timely warning
they would most certainly have been murdered.</p>

<p class="i1">Mr. Cumming and his companion reached Bulawayo on
Tuesday morning, and at once reported themselves to Mr.
Duncan, the Administrator.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time no organised force existed in the country,
with the exception of the few men of the Matabele Mounted
Police under Captain Southey; and there were only some 370
rifles in the Government stores. However, no difficulty was
experienced in getting men together who were ready to proceed
at once to the relief of their countrymen and countrywomen;
and, as I have already narrated, three small corps
under experienced leaders were despatched to various outlying
districts within a few hours of the time when the first alarm
was given. The Hon. Maurice Gifford, as energetic as he is
brave, got off that same evening with about forty men, including
Captain Southey and twelve of his Mounted Police; his object
being the relief of the men who had laagered up at Cumming's
store. The first sign of the rising seen by this party was near
Woodford's store, about fourteen miles beyond Thaba Induna,
or twenty-six from Bulawayo. Here an abandoned waggon
was found standing in the road, the sixteen donkeys that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
been harnessed to it lying all of a heap dead. They had for the
most part been stabbed to death with assegais, but some had
been shot. Nothing on the waggon had been touched, though it
was loaded with flour, whisky, etc. No trace of those who had
been in charge of the waggon could be discovered, but it has
been subsequently ascertained that they were murdered in the
bush some little distance away. They were colonial boys
taking down a load of stores to the Insiza district. Soon
after this derelict waggon had been passed, three colonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
boys were met making their way to Bulawayo, one armed
with a rifle and another with a revolver. They reported to
Mr. Gifford that the rising was general in the Insiza district,
and said that a Dr. and Mrs. Langford had been killed on the
previous day—Wednesday, 25th March—near Rixon's farm;
but that Mr. Rixon, the Blicks, and others in the district had
escaped to the laager at Cumming's store. They also told
Mr. Gifford that they had seen several troops of cattle being
driven by armed Matabele towards the Malungwani and
Matopo Hills. On meeting Mr. Gifford these "boys" turned
back and accompanied him to the Insiza, and did good
service in the subsequent fight, in which one of them was
wounded.</p>

<p class="i1">On Thursday night the relief party reached Cumming's
store, where they found about thirty men in laager. Of these,
however, a large proportion were unarmed, so that Mr.
Gifford had only about fifty rifles at his command altogether.
The night passed off quietly, but at about 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, just before
daylight on Friday morning, a most determined attack was
made on the position by a large party of Matabele, who did
not finally retreat until they had suffered heavy loss from the
steady fire of the white men. The natives came on with the
utmost fearlessness, as may be inferred from the fact that one
was killed with his hands on the window-sill of the store,
whilst six others lay dead close round; and it was afterwards
ascertained that their total loss was twenty-five.</p>

<p class="i1">On the side of the whites, Sergt.-Major O'Leary of the
Matabele Mounted Police was killed, as well as an educated
American negro, a servant of Mr. Wrey's, whilst six white
men were wounded. As soon as the attack had been completely
beaten off, the waggons were inspanned, and the
beleaguered white men broke up their laager and commenced
their retreat to Bulawayo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">The first portion of the road to be travelled led amongst
broken wooded hills, through which it was expected they
would have to fight their way; but although the Matabele
once gathered on the top of a neighbouring hill, and seemed
about to attack, they did not do so, and thus allowed the
whites to get out into the open country, where they were
comparatively safe, without further molestation.</p>

<p class="i1">I think it will not be out of place to here reproduce, with
the kind permission of Mr. Maurice Gifford, two letters written
by him on the night after the fight, of which I happen to
have copies, as they cannot fail, I think, to interest my
readers.</p>

<p class="i1"><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>—We have relieved Insiza, and brought away
thirty-six men and one woman. At 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> this morning were
attacked and enemy repulsed. Details of same will be given you
by bearer. We have at present six wounded, and the woman

the following for your consideration and for our assistance.
Send out two large American spiders with mules to bring them
in. Leave it to your judgment to say whether you consider
escort necessary. Suggest fifteen men. We can then bring in
the remainder of the party. I am sending two men who have
brought me dispatches this morning from Napier to advise him
of the serious nature of this rising; but again leave it to your
judgment whether you consider it advisable to send him advice
from your end, taking into consideration the possibility of these
two men not being able to reach him. If a doctor can come with
the spiders, so much the better; also suggest making arrangements
for beds for wounded. Advise me as to your knowledge
of any possible attacks from natives <i>en route</i> from here to Bulawayo.

were shot alongside the walls of our barricade. I mention this
to you to put you on your guard, as you must have many new

were well prepared. This, in my opinion, will prove a more

action is necessary.—Yours,</p>

<p class="chapsum">Difficulties of the colonists much underrated—The Matabele campaign of
1893—Military spirit scotched, not killed—Estimated native losses—Disarmament
of Matabele incomplete—Natives well supplied with arms
and ammunition—Defections amongst the native police.</p>


<p><span class="sc">As</span> will be seen from the last sentence of Mr. Gifford's letter
to Colonel Napier, even at this early stage of the insurrection
he predicted that it would prove a more serious business than
the first war, and that this prediction has been fully justified
will never I think be gainsaid by any man who has taken
part in both campaigns. As, however, the difficulties experienced
by the colonists in coping with the present rebellion
have been very much underrated in certain quarters, and
invidious comparisons instituted between Dr. Jameson's
victorious march on Bulawayo in 1893 and the conduct of
the present campaign, I will take the liberty of giving my
own opinion on the subject; which is that the essential differences
in the circumstances under which the two campaigns
were conducted render it impossible to institute any comparison
between them. In 1893 Dr. Jameson marched from
Mashunaland to Bulawayo with a compact force of 670 white
men, 400 of whom were mounted, a small number of native
allies, and a strong party of artillery consisting of 5 Maxim
guns, 2 seven-pounders, 1 Gardner gun, and 1 Hotchkiss.
Choosing its own line, and under the guidance of Nyenyezi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
—a Matabele of high position, whose whole family to the
number of seventy had lately been put to death by the order
of Lo Bengula, and who was himself a proscribed fugitive—this
force kept in the open country as much as possible, but
were obliged to pass through some broken wooded country
in the neighbourhood of the Tchangani river. Here, at
4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on the morning of the 25th of October, it was attacked
for the first time by the eastern division of the Matabele
army, computed at some 5000 strong, though it is improbable
that all the regiments composing this division were actually
engaged, as all the fighting seems to have been done by the
the Insukamini regiment, aided by small detachments of the
Inhlati and Umquicho.</p>

<p class="i1">The attack failed, the Matabele being beaten off from the
laager with heavy loss, whilst the column marched on
towards Bulawayo, and was not again attacked until after the
Impembisi had been crossed.</p>

<p class="i1">At a point a few miles beyond this river the laager was
again attacked on 1st November, this time in perfectly open
ground, and in the middle of the day. The attack was made
by the Imbezu and Ingubu regiments, computed by Sir John
Willoughby to number together about 1700 men; some 5000
more of other regiments who were hanging round never
having come into action at all. In this engagement these two
regiments suffered very heavily from the fire of the Maxim
guns, although, as they have both reformed and taken a
prominent part in the present rebellion, they were certainly
not annihilated. On hearing of the defeat of the Imbezu and
Ingubu, one or other of which regiments he usually kept near
him as a sort of bodyguard, Lo Bengula fled from Bulawayo,
after first burning the kraal and blowing up his European
house; but before doing so he recalled his son-in-law, Gambo,
from the Mangwe Pass, thus leaving it open for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
unopposed advance of the southern column under Colonel
Gould Adams, who with the 400 men under his command was
thus enabled to effect a junction with Dr. Jameson on 15th
November. Gambo had been in command of all the regiments
composing the Eegapa and the Umschlopay, the two
largest military divisions of the four into which the country
was divided, numbering together at least 8000 men. Excepting,
however, a small detachment which attacked Colonel
Gould Adams at the Singuesi river, none of the men composing
this force took any part in the first Matabele war, although
it numbered in its ranks some of the king's best regiments,
such as the Inyama Nghlovu and M'schlaschlanglela. Neither
were the men under Sikombo, Umlugulu, and many other
influential Indunas living to the south-east of Bulawayo, ever
engaged in the first war, as although they were all mustered
and were close to Bulawayo at the time of the defeat of their
compatriots at the Impembisi, they seem to have lost heart
when they heard of the disastrous result of that fight,
immediately followed as it was by the flight of their king,
and so retired to the Matopo Hills, and subsequently surrendered
without fighting.</p>

<p class="i1">The death of Lo Bengula probably closed the campaign,
for but for this event his pursuit to the lower Tchangani,
resulting as it did in the death of Major Wilson and all his
brave companions, would scarcely have had any other effect
than to show the Matabele that although white men were
invincible when defending a laager with Maxim guns,
they were by no means so when only armed with rifles, if
they could be outnumbered and surrounded in difficult
country.</p>

<p class="i1">But the death of their king left them like a swarm of
bees bereft of their queen. Their councils were divided;
their military arrogance crushed out of them by the heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
defeats their best regiments had sustained at the Tchangani,
the Impembisi, and in a minor degree at the Singuesi. Short
of food, and living like wild beasts in the rocks and forests,
with all the bitter discomfort which such a life entails even
on savages during the rainy season in a sub-tropical country,
they saw their women and children sicken and die day by
day, until their only hope of life seemed to lie in a speedy
return to the high and healthy plateau from which they had
fled. But there lay the laagers of the white men strongly
defended with cannon and Maxim guns. From such positions
they could not hope to drive them, nor without a
leader or any cohesion between the numberless little
parties into which they were divided did they dare to
try conclusions with the mounted patrols which scoured
the open country. What wonder then that when liberal
terms of peace were offered them, first one Induna with
all his people, and then another and another, surrendered,
until in a short time the whole nation had freely and
frankly submitted itself to the white man's rule? Such
is a brief account of the conquest of Matabeleland in 1893,
which was practically settled by two battles, in which the
Matabele attacked the white men in laager and were in each
case driven off with heavy loss by the fire of the Maxim
guns.</p>

<p class="i1">The brilliancy of the exploit, resulting as it did in the
overthrow of one of the most cruel and barbarous despotisms
that has ever existed even in barbarous Africa, and in the
throwing open to European enterprise of a rich and fertile
territory, blessed with a climate in which white men can live
and thrive, will ever be remembered as one of the most
brilliant episodes in the history of British colonisation in
South Africa; and no one, in this country at any rate, would
wish to detract one iota from the honour due to all those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
took part in Dr. Jameson's historic march to Bulawayo in
1893. It was admirable both in the boldness of its conception
and the steady and unflinching resolution with which it was
carried out.</p>

<p class="i1">All I wish to point out is that in 1893 the fighting power
and the military spirit of the Matabele nation was only
scotched, not killed; for more than half the regiments which
had formed the king's army at the time of the war did not
lose a single man during the hostilities, never having been
engaged in any of the fights; whilst the only regiments which
lost really heavily were the Insukamini, the Imbezu, and the
Ingubu. It is difficult to state with any degree of exactitude
the number of men lost by the Matabele in 1893, but personally
I find it difficult to believe that their loss in men
killed or who died from wounds can have exceeded 1000—that
is, 200 at the Tchangani, 500 at the Impembisi, 100 at
the Inguesi, and 200 killed during the fighting on the lower
Tchangani. Be it remembered by those who consider this
too low an estimate, that if more than 500 Matabele were
killed at the Impembisi fight, it would mean over 30 per cent
of the entire force engaged, as the strength of the Imbezu and
Ingubu together did not exceed 1700, whilst the number of
the survivors who have been and still are taking part in the
present rebellion is by no means inconsiderable. As regards
the loss inflicted on the Matabele by Major Wilson and his
brave companions during their last desperate stand on the
lower Tchangani, we have nothing to go upon, except what
natives who were there can tell us, and I think there is
reason to believe that their loss there was not actually so
heavy as at one time it was supposed to be, as they were
always able to fire on the whites from behind the shelter of
trees. Apart, however, from the direct loss sustained in the
various fights, the Matabele must have suffered heavily from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the ravages of sickness caused by exposure and want of food
after the fighting had ceased. The greatest sufferers were
naturally the women and children, the able-bodied men
having been better able to withstand the unaccustomed hardships.
Altogether, I think that if to the 1000, which is my
estimate of those killed in battle, or who died from the effects
of their wounds, another 1000 is added for the able-bodied
men who died of sickness afterwards, the aggregate will be a
very liberal allowance for the total losses sustained by the
Matabele in fighting men during, and in consequence of, the
war of 1893.</p>

<p class="i1">However, to avoid all cavilling let us add another 1000
to this number, making 3000 altogether. Subtract these
3000 from the entire fighting strength of the nation before
the war, which has never been estimated at less than 20,000,
and it leaves a residue of 17,000 able-bodied men. This
total may be a thousand or two out one way or the other; but,
whatever the fighting strength of the nation may be, every
man composing it throughout the length and breadth of the
land is now in arms against the white men, with the exception
of some of Gambo's people and a few others, numbering
in all under 1000 men, about whom I shall say a few words
later on.</p>

<p class="i1">But, it has been said, however many Matabele may have
rebelled against the Government, they cannot be very
dangerous foes, since the whole nation was disarmed after
the first war. This is an error. After the war of 1893 a
considerable number of guns were certainly given up, but
that the total handed in and destroyed was but a small
proportion of what they had possessed before the war no one
who knew anything about the matter ever doubted. Besides
muzzle-loading guns of every description, the Matabele were
formerly in possession of at least 2000 breech-loading rifles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
principally Martini-Henrys, a certain number of which were
captured from them during the war or surrendered after
hostilities were over. As no count seems ever to have been
kept of the number of these rifles captured or handed in, no
exact figure can be given. General report says 150 to 300,
whilst the highest number I have ever heard ventured was
"between 400 and 500."</p>

<p class="i1">Even taking the highest number to be correct, considering
that a considerable number of Martini-Henry rifles have
been illicitly sold to the Matabele during the last two years,
that nearly 100 breech-loading rifles were taken over to the
enemy by the rebel police, whilst many more were captured
from murdered men during the first days of the rebellion, it
cannot be denied that they have regained more than they
lost, so that in the matter of breech-loading arms they entered
upon the present insurrection with a larger supply than they
possessed in 1893, whilst, as I have said before, however
many muzzle-loading guns they may have surrendered, they
kept back a great many which they are now using. As
regards ammunition, I, for one, certainly thought when the
present rebellion broke out that their supply would soon run
short, but it has not yet done so, and, moreover, it seems to
be fairly distributed through the whole nation, as every impi
with which we have yet been engaged has shown itself to be
well supplied, especially with Martini-Henry cartridges.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus we now see that after the first conquest of Matabeleland
a very large proportion of the former military strength
of the country was still available, and that although this
large number of able-bodied savages were apparently without
arms, their weapons were only hidden for the time being.
Where the large supply of ammunition which they have
proved themselves to be possessed of came from, I cannot
say. Probably large quantities were buried with the rifles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
after the first war, and this store has been constantly added
to by theft and illicit purchase ever since.</p>

<p class="i1">However, over two years of most submissive behaviour,
unbroken by any attempt whatever to rebel against the
authority of the Chartered Company, lulled every white man
in the country into a feeling of security which events have
not justified.</p>

<p class="i1">A native police force was raised, which was apparently
working admirably up to the time of the rebellion; and even
then, it is but fair to say, almost all the police who had been
first enrolled, and who had done more than a year's service,
held themselves aloof from the rebels, the great majority of
defections occurring amongst those who had been but lately
enrolled and amongst whom there was therefore little or no
<i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> spite of their submissive behaviour, it seems probable that
all the members of the late king's family and many of the
chief Indunas were only biding their time, and waiting for
an opportunity to try the chances of a rebellion against the
white man.</p>

<p class="i1">This opportunity did not present itself as long as there
was a strong police force in the country, but once that police
force was removed, I think the malcontents began to act.</p>

<p class="i1">That the plague of locusts with which Matabeleland has
been afflicted ever since 1890, the first year of the occupation
of Mashunaland by Europeans; the partial drought of the
last two years; and, finally, the outbreak of the rinderpest,
would all be ascribed to the evil influence of the white man, and
made use of by the witch-doctors to incite the mass of the
people to join the insurgents, is doubtless true; but that the
insurrection can be fairly ascribed to the bitterness caused
by these visitations alone, I very much doubt, for it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
remarkable that throughout the Umzingwani, Filibusi, and
Insiza districts, where all the first murders of white men
were committed, the rainfall had been plentiful, and the
locusts had done but little damage, so that, as I can personally
bear witness, the crops throughout these portions of the
country were exceptionally good, whilst as the rinderpest
had not yet approached this part of Matabeleland, the people
living in these districts could have known little or nothing
about it. In its inception, the insurrection was, in my
opinion, a rebellion against the white man's rule by the
Matabele of Zulu origin alone, and I am convinced that, in the
district where I was living at least, the other section of the
tribe were at first not in the secret; however, the greater
part of these soon joined, some unwillingly and under threats
from their former masters, but most of them readily enough,
believing, as they did, that with the assistance of the Umlimo
they would be able to completely root out the white man,
and revel once more in loot and wholesale murder. And a
merry time they had of it, if it was but a short one, to be
followed by a heavy retribution.</p>

<p class="i1">When the first news of the rising reached Bulawayo,
Gambo was in the town on a visit to the chief native commissioner,
by whom he was very wisely detained as a
prisoner. Whether, if he had been at large, he would have
joined the rebels or not, it is difficult to say. Since the war,
he has lost control over the greater part of the people who
formerly composed the Eegapa military division, and many
of these have joined the ranks of the insurgents, but all
Gambo's own people, under his head Induna, Marzwe, have
remained loyal to the Government. Umjan, once the Induna
of the Imbezu regiment, and now quite an old man, has also
refrained from taking part in the present hostilities, although
he is one of the few whose cattle were shot by order of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Government because they were infected with the rinderpest.
He came in to Bulawayo soon after the outbreak of the
rebellion with his wives and immediate attendants, and is
now living quietly near the town. His sons, however, have
joined the rebels, whilst the men whom he formerly commanded—the
Imbezu—reformed themselves into a regiment,
and have been fighting since the outbreak of the insurrection.</p>

<p class="i1">Besides Gambo's men, a few hundreds of Matabele Maholi
(men of Makalaka and Mashuna descent) living on my
Company's property of Essexvale, on Colonel Napier's land and
round the Hope Fountain mission station, have thought it
advisable to stand by the Government, and have, therefore,
come in to live near Bulawayo for protection. But putting
aside these few hundreds of natives who have not joined in
the rebellion, the fact remains that at least nine-tenths, I
think I might safely say nineteen-twentieths, of the Matabele
nation are now in arms against the whites.</p>

<p class="i1">And, now, let us see how the colonists were prepared to
meet the onset of these hordes of savages. When the rising
first broke out, with the exception of the native police, there
was no organised force in Matabeleland worth speaking of;
and as one-half of the native police at once went over to the
enemy, and the remainder had to be disarmed, for fear lest
they should follow suit, it may be said that there was no
police force at all. Of the old Mounted Police there only
remained forty-eight officers, non-commissioned officers, and
men, in the whole of Matabeleland, under Inspector Southey.
Of these, twenty-two were stationed in Bulawayo, and the
rest distributed over the country at the police stations of
Gwelo, Selukwe, Belingwe, Inyati, Mangwe, Tuli, Matopos,
Umzingwani, and Iron Mine Hill. When the rebellion broke
out only twelve of these men were available at Bulawayo for
immediate service, and these, under Inspector Southey, accompanied 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Mr. Gifford to the Insiza. The Rhodesia Horse,
a volunteer force which had been raised and equipped the
previous year, had also practically ceased to exist as an
effective force fit for use at a moment's notice, for although
there were some six hundred men in Matabeleland who had
enrolled themselves as members of this corps, they were
scattered all over the country at the outbreak of the rebellion.
Some of these were murdered, whilst others had to take
refuge in the laagers of Belingwe and Gwelo. However,
about five hundred were soon mustered in Bulawayo, but the
services of the majority could not be utilised except to defend
the town, owing to the want of horses, since, so great had
been the ravages of the fatal horse-sickness during the rainy
season then just coming to an end, that when Colonel Napier,
the senior officer of the Rhodesia Horse, called on the Government
for seventy horses for immediate use on 23rd March,
he could only be supplied with sixty-two.</p>

<p class="i1">The actual number of horses in the possession of the
Government throughout Matabeleland on the day when the
first tidings of the outbreak of the insurrection reached
Bulawayo is as follows:—</p>

good many never returned to Bulawayo, as they either died
of horse-sickness or were taken to Gwelo or Belingwe, so

<p class="i1">Making a total of 580 rifles all told.</p>

<p>Besides these, however, there were about eighty old Martini-Henry
rifles in the Government stores, but these were nearly
all unserviceable at the outbreak of the rebellion, though the
armourer has since been able to get most of them into working
order. Of ammunition there was a good supply, viz.
1,500,000 rounds.</p>

<p class="i1">In the way of artillery there was in Bulawayo when the
insurrection broke out one 303 Maxim gun in good order,
and a second so much out of repair as to be useless; two 2.5
screw guns in good order, but with only seventeen rounds of
ammunition for the two; one Hotchkiss gun and limber, one
Gatling, one Gardner, one Nordenfeldt—all in good order—and
one seven-pounder, useless except at Bulawayo owing
to carriage having been destroyed by white ants. In addition
to this ordnance there arrived in Bulawayo from Macloutsie,
on the very day on which Mr. Maddocks was murdered, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
old Maxims and two seven-pounders. These, however, were
unserviceable at the time, one of the seven-pounders being
without a carriage and the two Maxims being also out of
repair. The armourer here has now, however, I believe, put
them all in working order.</p>

<p class="i1">Taking these figures as correct—and they are absolutely
beyond question—it cannot, I think, be said that the
colonists in Matabeleland were very well prepared to cope
with a sudden and unexpected rising of at least 10,000
natives, about one-fifth of whom were armed with breech-loading
rifles and well supplied with ammunition, whilst
many more were in possession of muzzle-loading guns; and
when it is remembered that at the time of the outbreak the
food supply was very low in Bulawayo, owing to the ravages
of the rinderpest, it must be acknowledged that the position
was at one time a very serious one, which a little more intelligence
on the part of the Matabele might have rendered
absolutely disastrous.</p>

<p class="i1">But all through they have behaved in an incomprehensible
manner, their leaders apparently never having arranged any
settled plan of campaign, the consequence being that there
has never been any understanding or community of action
between the various hordes into which the nation is now
divided. All through there appears to have been a general
belief amongst them that they would receive supernatural
aid from the "Umlimo," or god, but this belief must be
getting a little thin now, and they would have done far better
had they worked together under one intelligent general.</p>

<p class="i1">Why, when the rebellion first broke out, they never
attempted to block the main road to Mangwe will ever
remain a mystery. No one doubts that they might have
done so, nor that, if they had placed a couple of thousand
men in the Shashani Pass, we could not have raised a sufficient 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
force on this side to dislodge them and open the road;
for it must be remembered that as there were over six
hundred women and children in Bulawayo a large force was
always necessary to protect them. Possibly there is some
truth in the report that the road to Mangwe has been purposely
left open by command of the Umlimo in order to
give the white men the opportunity of escaping from the
country. That this was an error of judgment, if it is a fact,
is very clear, as in the critical time but few men left the
country, and such as did could be well spared, as they were
of no use as defenders of the women and children, and were
only consuming valuable food. On the other hand, owing to
the road having been left open, stores of arms and food and
horses were constantly being brought in.</p>

<p class="i1">It certainly seems very strange that no attempt has ever
been made to stop waggons and coaches on this road, when
it is remembered that at one time Government House—which
is less than three miles from the centre of Bulawayo—was
practically in the hands of the rebels, sometimes in the daytime
and always at nights for a period of about ten days, their
impis during that time lying in a semicircle to the west and
north of the town, and being sometimes within two miles of it.</p>

<p class="i1">Yet although two Dutchmen, living in their waggon standing
near the boundary of the town commonage, about four
and a half miles along the road from Bulawayo, were murdered,
no waggon or coach moving along the road was ever interfered
with, nor was the Government House burnt, the reason for
this being, it is said, because the Umlimo told the people that
when Bulawayo had been destroyed, and all the white men
in the country killed, they would find Lo Bengula sitting there,
ready to rule them once more; for, be it said, Government
House has been built in the centre of the old kraal of
Bulawayo, just where the king's house once stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">For over a month, an impi, supposed to be at least a
thousand strong, was camped just within the Matopo Hills,
not ten miles from the nearest point on the road to Mangwe,
and no one doubts that at any moment a portion of this impi
might have moved over to the road by night, and, by shooting
a mule or two, have had a coachload of white men at its
mercy; and God help the unfortunate white man who has
nothing else to trust to but the mercy of the Matabele!</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there were forts along the road, and patrols rode
daily between the forts, but even so I maintain that much
damage might have been done if the natives had determined
at any moment to block the road. Now, however, that the
impi of which I have been speaking has been driven from its
position by the forces under Major-General Sir Frederick
Carrington, it is not likely that the safety of the road will
ever again be threatened.</p>

<p class="i1">And, now, let me hark back to the early days of the rebellion.
I think I have shown by figures that on the outbreak
of the insurrection the country was not over well supplied
with either horses or arms, nor was there any superfluity of
men, and the smallness of the number will, I think, astonish
some critics of the present campaign in England. Turning
to the <i>Matabele Times</i> of 6th April last, I find it stated under
the heading "The Native Rising up to Date," "A census
was taken of all those who had been in the laager on Friday
night as they made their exit on Saturday morning, or remained
on the waggons. The count was carefully made, and
showed that the refugees numbered 632 women and children,
and 915 men, making a total of 1547"; and further on we
read—"A general parade was held yesterday of the men now
in town who have enrolled themselves in the Bulawayo Field
Force. They fell in at ten o'clock, the scouts, under Captain
Grey, in front making a splendid display of the class of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
whom the hostile natives will not seek to tackle twice. The
men on foot looked like business, and went through their
movements with sufficient precision. The Africander Corps
now consists of three companies, numbering 76, 64, and 73,
with 6 on the staff. The total number on parade was over
500, of whom about 300 were fully armed, and about 100
were engineers and artillerymen. To this number have to be
added the 169 out under the Hon. M. Gifford and Captain
Dawson, and the 100 men gone down to Gwanda under
Captain Brand and Captain Van Niekerk. The total efficient
force now available for the reconquest of Matabeleland may
be put down at 700, nearer 800."</p>

<p class="i1">From these figures it will be seen that at the outbreak of
the rebellion there were under 1000 men in Bulawayo, some
200 of whom were unfit for active service. The remainder of
the male population of the country were shut up in the
laagers at Gwelo, Belingwe, and Mangwe, and therefore unavailable
for offensive operations against the Matabele; whilst
of the 800 fighting men in Bulawayo, it was necessary to
have at least 400 always in town to protect the women and
children, and 130 were drafted off to man the forts on the
Mangwe road, leaving less than 300 available for active
operations against the enemy. This force was, however,
augmented by about 150 Cape boys, chiefly Amaxosa Kafirs
and Zulus. These boys were got together and formed into a
regiment by Mr. Johan Colenbrander, and they have done
most excellent service during the present campaign, being
man for man both braver and better armed than the Matabele.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus, all things considered, I do not think the colonists
have done so badly. With small patrols they first succeeded
in bringing in many scattered whites from the outlying
districts, and then after a series of engagements, always
fought on ground of the enemy's own choosing, succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
driving them from the immediate neighbourhood of Bulawayo,
and forcing them to take refuge in the forests and hills, from
which they will be finally driven by the forces now in the
country under the command of Major-General Sir Frederick
Carrington.</p>

<p class="i1">It is worthy of remark that whilst in the first war the
Matabele attacked strong positions defended by artillery and
Maxim guns, thereby suffering very heavy loss themselves
but killing very few white men, in the present war all the
fighting has been amongst broken ground, and in country
more or less covered with bush, and all the killing has been
done with rifles; for in the first war the natives learnt the
futility of attacking fortified positions, and now only fight in
the bush in skirmishing order, giving but little opportunity
for the effective use of machine guns; so that, although a
good many rounds have been fired from Maxims at long
ranges, only a very small amount of execution has been done
by them.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Cattle stolen by Matabele—I recover the cattle and burn down Matabele
kraal—Start in pursuit of cattle-thieves—Surprise a raiding party and
recover two bands of cattle—Reflections on the situation.</p>


<p><span class="sc">I will</span> now again take up the thread of my own personal
experiences. As will be remembered, I reached my homestead
at 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on Thursday, 26th March, and found everything
as I had left it seventeen hours before. A mule cart
carrying food supplies for my men was to have followed
immediately behind us, but the men in charge lost the road,
and the provisions did not turn up till late the next day.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning, just at daybreak, a native named
Inshlupo, who had been in charge of a herd of over thirty head
of cattle belonging to my Company, turned up and informed
me that on the previous evening the headman of a small
Matabele kraal, situated in the broken ground just below the
Malungwani Hills, had paid him a visit, accompanied by
several armed men, and taken off all the cattle.</p>

<p class="i1">On the receipt of this news I had the horses saddled up
at once, as, it being still so early, I had little doubt that,
if no time was lost, we should find the stolen cattle still in
the kraal to which they had been taken the previous evening.
Before moving, however, I said a few words to my men,
telling them that my object in visiting Essexvale and other
parts of the country with an armed force was twofold, namely,
to endeavour by prompt action to strike terror into the hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of some of the rebels before they had time to concentrate,
and at the same time to reassure those who were content with
the white man's rule, but who, in the absence of any display
of power on the part of the Government, might be led to
believe that their only chance of safety from the vengeance of
the Matabele lay in taking part with them in the rebellion.
In conclusion, I told them that any Kafirs we might find
with arms in their hands, who had left their kraals and gone off
into the hills with stolen cattle, ought to be shot without
question and without mercy, as they were every one of them
more or less responsible for the cruel murders of white men that
had already been committed.</p>

<p class="i1">Under the guidance of Inshlupo we reached the neighbourhood
of the kraal where I hoped to find my Company's
cattle before the sun was an hour higher. Here I halted my
men, and sent half of them round under the shelter of the
bush to a certain point where they were to show themselves,
that being the signal for a simultaneous advance as rapidly
as possible on the kraal from both sides. However,
although we found all the cattle still in the kraal, there were
no men there, and in fact no one but a Matabele woman,
the wife of the headman, and several children. The woman
would offer no explanation of the undeniable fact that my
Company's cattle were in her husband's kraal, and would
give no information concerning his whereabouts, so, after
driving out the stolen cattle, I had the whole place burnt,
first allowing the woman to remove all her private effects.
When this had been done, I sent the recaptured cattle back
to the homestead, in charge of two of Inshlupo's boys, and
then proceeded straight into the Malungwani Hills, in the
hope of coming across some of the rebels who had gone off
with the first lot of my Company's cattle that had been
stolen on the previous Tuesday night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">As we proceeded, the hills became thickly wooded, and
in the valleys between them we found the spoor of a good
many cattle that had passed during the last two days,
although we saw no fresh tracks.</p>

<p class="i1">About nine o'clock I gave the order to off-saddle in a
little grassy hollow, after first placing sentries all round to
guard against any sudden attack, for we were now, of course,
in the enemy's country. After an hour's rest the horses were
just being caught when one of the sentries reported that a
herd of cattle was being driven up a valley at the foot of a
high ridge to our left. I at once went up to have a look
myself, but by this time the cattle were out of sight. However,
I carefully examined the ground, and saw that by
following another valley running parallel to the one in which
the cattle had been seen, and then ascending the steep ridge
at its head, we should in all probability drop right on to the
rebels in charge of them.</p>

<p class="i1">And this is exactly what happened, as upon cresting the
ridge we found that both Kafirs and cattle were immediately
below us. Some of the former were driving the cattle, but
most of them were in the bush ahead. We at once opened
fire on them, which they made no attempt to return. Indeed,
taken by surprise as they were, and having so much
the worse of the position, and, moreover, not being in any
force, they could scarcely be expected to do anything else
but run for it. And run they did, throwing down almost
everything they were carrying, and abandoning the cattle.
I saw one man throw a gun away, probably fearing lest he
should be caught with it in his possession, but most of them
were, I think, only armed with assegais. We chased them
up and down several hills, and expended a lot of ammunition
on them, but did them I am afraid very little damage,
as the hills were all thickly wooded, and our horses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
not able to climb up and down them any faster than the
light-footed savages we were pursuing. In the second valley
we found another herd of cattle, but could see no Kafirs near
them, and I think they must have heard the firing, and run
off before we came in sight. Altogether we captured over
150 head of cattle, every one of which had been taken from
white men, a large number having Mr. Colenbrander's brand
on them.</p>

<p class="i1">I have stated plainly that we fired on these Kafirs at
sight, and that although they offered no resistance, but ran
away as hard as they could, we chased them and kept on
firing at them as long as we could see them, and this action
may possibly be cited as an example of the brutality and
inhumanity of the Englishmen in Rhodesia. The fact that
the Kafirs whom we sought to destroy—with as little compunction
as though they were a pack of wild dogs—were
taking part in a rebellion which had just been inaugurated
by a series of the foulest murders it is possible to conceive,
and the ultimate object of which was evidently to stamp
out the white man throughout the land, will, of course, be
entirely lost sight of or quietly ignored. In fact, I should
not be at all surprised to see it stated that the rebellion was
caused by the inhuman behaviour of the white men in
Rhodesia, who, it will be said, were in the habit of shooting
down the poor, meek, inoffensive Matabele.</p>

<p class="i1">The Kafirs upon whom we fired were, of course, caught
red-handed, driving off a herd of cattle, every animal in
which had been taken from a white man, and we afterwards
learnt that they were the very men who had stopped Mr.
Meikle's waggon two days before on the Insiza road (some
eight or ten miles distant), murdered the colonial boys in
charge of it, and assegaied the sixteen donkeys harnessed
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">For breaking out into rebellion against the white man's
rule, and for taking all the cattle in the country, I should
have borne them no great animosity, especially as the great
majority of these cattle had once belonged to their king or to
them personally. Being a representative of the race that
had conquered them, I should, of course, have lent the
services of my rifle to help to quell the rebellion no matter
what form it had taken; but had it not been accompanied by
the cruel murders of white women and children, I should
not have been animated by the same vengeful feelings as
now possessed me, as well as every other white man in Matabeleland.</p>

<p class="i1">"But," the kind-hearted, untravelled humanitarian may
say, "such incidents are the necessary accompaniments of a
native rebellion against Europeans, and ought not therefore
to excite any greater surprise or indignation in your colonist
than they do in myself; and, moreover, given that you admit
that, looking at things from their point of view, the Matabele
were justified in rebelling against the white man's rule, go
further and acknowledge that the white men were wrong in
ever attempting the colonisation of any of the territories
between the Limpopo and the Zambesi, since it was the
occupation of Mashunaland in 1890 that led to the various
disagreements between Lo Bengula and the Chartered Company
which culminated in the invasion and conquest of
Matabeleland in 1893."</p>

<p class="i1">To this proposition I would answer that the whole question
of the colonisation by Europeans of countries previously
inhabited by savage tribes must be looked upon from a broad
point of view, and be judged by its final results as compared
with the primitive conditions it has superseded. Two
hundred years ago, the Eastern States of North America were
inhabited by savage tribes who, by incessant internecine war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and the practice of many abominable customs, constantly
deluged the whole land with blood. Now the noble red man
has disappeared from those territories—has been exterminated
by the more intelligent white man—and in place of a cruel,
hopeless savagery there has arisen a civilisation whose ideals
are surely higher than those of the displaced barbarism. In
like manner, before Van Kiebek landed at the Cape of Good
Hope, the whole of South Africa was in the hands of savages,
a people, be it noted, who were not living in Arcadian
simplicity, a peaceful happy race amongst whom crime and
misery were unknown quantities, but on the contrary, who
were a prey to cruel superstitions, involving a constant
sacrifice of innocent life, and who were, moreover, continually
exposed to all the horrors of intertribal wars. Now an
orderly civilisation has been established over a large area of
this once completely savage country, and no one but an
ignorant fanatic would, I think, assert that its present condition
is not preferable from a humanitarian point of view to its
former barbarism. Well, the present state of Matabeleland
is one of transition. Its past history—and this fact ought not
to be ignored by the impartial critic of what is happening
there to-day—has been one of ceaseless cruelty and bloodshed.
But in time a civilisation will have been built up in that
blood-stained land, as orderly and humane as that which has
been established—in place of a parallel barbarism—in the
older States of South Africa.</p>

<p class="i1">Yet, just as in the establishment of the white man's
supremacy in the Cape Colony, the aboriginal black races
have either been displaced or reduced to a state of submission
to the white man's rule at the cost of much blood and
injustice to the black man, so also will it be in Matabeleland,
and so must it ever be in any country where the European
comes into contact with native races, and where at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
time the climate is such that the more highly organised and
intelligent race can live and thrive, as it can do in Matabeleland;
whilst the presence of valuable minerals or anything
else that excites the greed of the stronger race will naturally
hasten the process. Therefore Matabeleland is doomed by
what seems a law of nature to be ruled by the white man,
and the black man must go, or conform to the white man's
laws, or die in resisting them. It seems a hard and cruel
fate for the black man, but it is a destiny which the broadest
philanthropy cannot avert, whilst the British colonist is but
the irresponsible atom employed in carrying out a preordained
law—the law which has ruled upon this planet ever since, in
the far-off misty depths of time, organic life was first evolved
upon the earth—the inexorable law which Darwin has aptly
termed the "Survival of the Fittest."</p>

<p class="i1">Now there may be those who maintain that the aboriginal
savagery of the Red Indians in the Eastern States of North
America, or of the Kafirs in the Cape Colony, was a preferable
state of things to the imperfect civilisations which have
superseded them. To such I have no reply. "Chacun à
son goût." Only I would ask them to endeavour to make
themselves as well acquainted as possible with the subject
under discussion, either by actual travel or by reading, and I
would beg them not to accept too readily the assertions constantly
made without any regard to truth or honesty by
the newspaper opponents of British colonisation, which are
broadly to the effect that no savagery exists in Africa except
that practised on the blacks by Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span> on the afternoon of Thursday, 26th March, we got back
to my homestead with the recaptured cattle, both men and
horses were tired out, as the heat had been intense, and the
former had had no food since early dawn. However, the
cart carrying provisions having arrived, the men were soon
able to get a good meal, whilst the horses were turned into
a twenty-five acre patch of maize, which, although it had been
sadly destroyed as a crop by the locusts, still afforded an
abundance of sweet succulent food for stock. In order to
allow the horses time to recover from the effects of their hard
day's work in the hills, I resolved to let them feed and rest
until the cool of the afternoon of the following day, and then
make a night march over to Mr. Jackson's police station at
Makupikupeni, where I hoped to be able to get some news as
to the whereabouts of Colonel Spreckley's patrol, with which
I was anxious to effect a junction. I should have sent the

the rinderpest scourge which would have rendered such a
course worse than useless, since every one of them would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
died within a week. The only other plan open to me was
to commit them to the care of the natives living immediately
round my homestead, who, at this time at any rate, did not
seem at all inclined to take part in the rebellion.</p>

<p class="i1">As there were now at least 500 head of cattle collected
together in a small area, I fully recognised the danger there
would be lest so rich a bait should attract a Matabele raiding
party as soon as it became known that there was no one left
to defend them. However, no other course was open to me,
so the cattle were left on the off chance that they would not
fall into the hands of the rebels.</p>

<p class="i1">Some ten days later the not unexpected came to pass.
Inxnozan, an old Matabele warrior, whom I knew well, and
whose manly independent bearing I had always admired,
descended upon my homestead with a following of some 300
men, burnt down my house and stables and all adjoining
storehouses and huts, and either carried off or destroyed
everything they contained. Then they collected all the
cattle in the neighbourhood, all of which belonged to my
Company by right of purchase or capture, and went off. All
the Kafirs who up to this time had been living quietly in
their kraals looking after my cattle went away into the hills
after Inxnozan's visit, and as they have never sent me any
message, I do not know whether they have joined the rebels
or have only taken refuge in the hills until the war is over.
At any rate I shall do all I can to protect them, as they must
have been placed in a very difficult position—fearing the
enmity of the rebels on the one hand, if they refused to join
them, and the vengeance of the white man on the other for
suspected complicity in some of the outrages that had taken
place in the district if they remained at their kraals.</p>

<p class="i1">On the Friday afternoon we made a start for Mr.
Jackson's police station, passing the remains of the once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
large military kraal of Intuntini, and still the largest in the
district. Such as it was, we set it alight, and as it was
situated on the shoulder of a hill the burning huts must
have been plainly visible to the people who had so lately
deserted it, from almost any point in the Malungwani range,
to which they had probably retired.</p>

<p class="i1">Shortly after midnight we reached the police station,
which we found entirely deserted, though all the huts were
still standing. A closer inspection showed that these huts
had been very hastily evacuated by the native police to
whom they had belonged, as they were still full of their
personal effects, such as coats, hats, blankets, etc. In one of
the huts we found a broken Winchester rifle, and in one of
the coats a purse containing a few shillings in silver, about
the last thing a Kafir would willingly leave behind him.
We afterwards learned that Colonel Spreckley's patrol had
reached the police station—which was situated on the main
road to the Filibusi district from Bulawayo—late at night
on the previous Wednesday. At this time there were seven
native policemen with a sergeant in the huts. These men,
hearing the horsemen approaching, immediately fled, taking
nothing with them but their arms and ammunition, and went
over to the rebels. That they must have previously made up
their minds to desert, is, I think, certain, otherwise there was
no reason why they should have left the station of which
they were in charge on the approach of the white men. In
one of the huts we found several bags of maize, and so were
able to give all our horses a good feed.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning I paid a visit to several kraals
in the neighbourhood, the inhabitants of which were in
charge of cattle belonging to my Company. These people I
found in their villages. They were subsequently attacked
by the rebels, who carried off a large proportion of the cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in their charge. They however escaped with the remainder,
which they brought in to Bulawayo, where they very soon all
died of rinderpest. These Kafirs are amongst the few who
out of the entire nation have stood by the Government and
rendered active assistance to the white men during the
present crisis. They are Matabele Maholi of Makalaka
descent, as I think are all the "friendlies," with the exception
of a small leavening amongst them of "Abenzantsi" or Matabele
of pure Zulu blood, and I think I am correct in stating
that there is not a single Maholi of any other descent who is
not in arms with the pure-blooded Matabele against the
Government.</p>

<p class="i1">The Makalaka proper, a numerous people living on the
western border of Matabeleland, have—except possibly with
some individual exceptions—held themselves resolutely
aloof from any participation in the present rebellion, just
as they took no part in the war of 1893. They are an
industrious, peaceable people, and have found the rule of the
Chartered Company if not perfect, at any rate a vast improvement
on the oppressive tyranny under which they lived in
the good old days of Lo Bengula.</p>

<p class="i1">At Makupikupeni we heard a rumour, which happily
proved to be entirely false, though at the time it disturbed
my peace of mind very much, to the effect that the ninety
native police who had accompanied Mr. Jackson and his
companions into the Matopo Hills, on the trail of Umzobo
and Umfondisi, had mutinied and murdered their officers,
Mr. Jackson having been bound to a tree, and then having
had his throat cut. We also heard that Colonel Spreckley
had buried the white men who were murdered at Edkins'
store, and then crossed over to the Tuli road and returned to
Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">This being so, I determined to make for Spiro's store,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
situated just on the edge of the Matopo Hills on the main
road from Bulawayo to the Transvaal, and about twelve miles
distant from the Makupikupeni police station, as I was in
hopes of there hearing something authentic concerning the
fate of my friend Mr. Jackson and his companions. I knew
the way across country to the store well enough myself, but
had I not done so, I had a good guide with me in the person
of one Mazhlabanyan, a Matabele—not of Zulu blood, but of
Makalaka descent—who had joined me that morning. This
man had known me in former years when he was an
elephant-hunter in the employ of the late Mr. Thomas,
and on hearing that I was residing on Essexvale, had come
with his wives and family to live near me, and I had given
him a nice little herd of cattle—amongst them some good
milk cows—to look after for our Company, for which he was
very grateful. He fought in the war of 1893 against the
whites and was with the Imbezu at the battle of the Impembisi,
on which occasion he was the recipient of a bullet
through the shoulder.</p>

<p class="i1">During the present troubles, however, he has stood by
the Government, and joined the rest of the "friendlies."
Shortly before sundown we reached Spiro's store, which we
found had been deserted by its occupants not many hours
prior to our arrival. The colonial boys in charge of the
coach mules were still at their post, and reported everything
quiet in the district as far as they knew, nor could they give
any information concerning Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p class="i1">Since mid-day the weather, which had been intensely dry
and hot for some time past, had changed suddenly, the sky
became overcast and a light rain commenced to fall. Luckily,
however, there proved to be sufficient accommodation in the
out-buildings and beneath the broad verandah which surrounded
the store for all my men, and we were thus spared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the disagreeable necessity of sleeping out on the wet ground
and beneath a rainy sky.</p>

<p class="i1">The next day—Sunday, 29th March—broke fine, but
cool and cloudy, a very pleasant change after the excessive
heat we had recently experienced. The question now arose
as to whether any other course was open to me but to return
at once to Bulawayo by the Tuli road. To my left lay the
rugged mass of broken granite hills called the Matopos, within
whose recesses it was believed by many people at Bulawayo
that the Matabele had already massed in large numbers.
Now I fully realised that had this been the case, it would
have been madness to take so small a force as that at my
disposal into so difficult a country. As, however, I had very
good reasons for believing that as yet no large number of
Matabele had assembled in this part of the country, I was
anxious to make a reconnaissance through them in order to
see what the difficulties of the country really were.</p>

<p class="i1">Before starting I paraded my men and told them what I
wished to do, stating that in my opinion, although we should
have some very rough country to get over, and should have to
walk and lead our horses most of the way, we should not
meet any large force of hostile Kafirs, or indeed be likely to
fire a shot at all unless we met some of the revolted police
who had murdered Jackson—for at this time I believed that
he had really been murdered. However, I told them that I
did not wish any one to go with me who did not care to do
so, which was unnecessary, as no one was willing to be left
behind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> was about seven o'clock when we entered the first gorge
leading in amongst the foothills, which were here well wooded.
Mr. Blöcker, who is an excellent walker and a very good shot,
I told off to scout on foot a short distance ahead of us, whilst
Messrs. Simms and Fletcher, two Cape Colonists and both
steady, reliable men, scouted on the left and right flanks
respectively.</p>

<p class="i1">After we had proceeded for about an hour through very
broken and, for the most part, thickly wooded country, we
emerged upon a huge bare granite rock. Here Mr. Simms
rejoined us and reported that as he was scouting on the left
flank, upon emerging from a patch of bush, he had come
suddenly upon four Kafirs, one carrying a gun whilst the rest
were armed with assegais. These men quickly moved out of
sight, fearing to attack Simms lest there should prove to be
more white men behind him, whilst he on his side did not
care to fire on them, as he did not know how many more
natives there might be close at hand.</p>

    <span class="sc">View in the Matopo Hills.</span></div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Beyond us there now lay a large open grassy valley
enclosed on every side by rocky granite hills. In its broadest
part this valley was over a mile in width, but at its top end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
it gradually narrowed into a rocky gorge, which apparently
led on to some higher ground beyond the farthest hills we
could see. Much of the valley was under cultivation, and a
splendid crop of corn was standing, still unreaped, in the
fields. Mazhlabanyan told me that these cornfields belonged
to Banyubi, a tribe allied to the Makalakas, and who are the
aboriginal inhabitants of the district. After carefully looking
over the country on ahead, I decided to keep straight up the
valley, and make my way to the higher ground by the gorge
I have spoken of. When we were half-way through the open
valley, Kafirs began to shout to one another amongst the hills
to our left, and presently we saw some, but they were a long
way off and we could not make out whether they were armed
or not. I now gave orders that any Kafir who approached us
must be fired on if he was armed, but not unless.</p>

<p class="i1">We had just entered the neck of the gorge and were
finding a good deal of difficulty in getting our horses through
a stream that was too deep to ford and could only be crossed
on flat slippery stones, when some shots were fired at us from
a rocky kopje about 300 yards to our left rear. However, as
the Kafirs who had fired were hidden behind rocks, we could
see nothing of them, nor did we catch a glimpse of the enemy
until we had all crossed the stream. We then saw a few
natives amongst the wooded hills directly ahead of us, and at
once commenced a skirmishing fight with them. They were
in no great numbers, and they retired before us without firing
many shots or giving us much of a chance at them. In this
way we had advanced slowly but steadily in extended order
for about 300 yards through rocks and bush when we suddenly
came upon a kraal filled with cattle, at the foot of a mass of
bare castellated rocks. From these rocks we drove the
enemy, without any loss on our side, though many of us were
fired at at very close quarters, but, as has so often been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
remarked, Kafirs always make wretched shooting if at all
hustled. Personally I had one little piece of luck. A Kafir
had fired either at me or Mr. Blöcker—we were close together—from
behind a buttress of rock, and as I knew that his rifle
was therefore empty, and hoped he had been alone, I ran up
the flat slope of rock on which I was standing, thinking to get
a good shot at him round the corner of the rock. When I
got there, however, I did not see the man who had fired at
me, but found another Kafir waiting for me with his rifle at
his shoulder. He was on a lower level than the rock slab on
which I was standing, and must have heard me approaching
as he was evidently on the lookout for me to show myself. I
was carrying my own rifle at the ready, but had to get it up
to my shoulder before I could fire. There was no time to get
a sight, so, looking at him, I raised my rifle as quickly as
possible and fired, and at almost the same moment he fired at
me. The result was mutually disappointing, as we both
missed our mark. How I managed to make so bad a shot I
don't know, as the Kafir was not more than fifteen yards from
me. However, had I waited for the few seconds necessary
to get the sight on him, he might very likely have shot me
first, whilst my quick snap-shot very probably disconcerted
him and made him miss. Immediately he had fired, he
dodged behind a rock, and I did not get another chance at him.</p>

<p class="i1">We now took possession of the rocks above the cattle
kraal, and got a few good shots at a lot of Kafirs running
away amongst the trees to the left. Having placed several
men as sentinels on the highest boulders, I went down to look
at the cattle, considering it very bad luck having ever come
across them, as I did not like to leave them and then
continue my reconnaissance, nor did I think it would be
possible to drive them out of the hills to the Tuli road without
any Kafirs on foot to help. I first thought of shooting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
lot, but as there were over a hundred, could not spare the
ammunition that would have been required for the purpose.
I therefore determined to try and drive them out of the
hills and take them to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">With a great deal of trouble we got them down to the
broken ground above the stream, but farther than this we
could not drive them, as they scattered in all directions, but
would not go down the rocks. Over and over again we
rounded them up and tried to force them to go the way we
wanted them to take, but without success, and I was once
more thinking of shooting them all when some shots were
fired at us from the broken ground to our left front. By a
mistake the sentinels had left their posts on the top of the
rocks and rejoined the rest of our party, and the Kafirs, now
heavily reinforced, had got back to positions amongst the
wooded cliffs above us without being observed. I at once
sent Mr. Blöcker and a few men who were good shots to
take up a position beyond the stream, from which they could
check the enemy's fire, whilst the rest of the men were
crossing. I myself with Mr. Claude Grenfell and a few
more men protected the rear. However, before we got down
into the open ground, we had four horses killed and two
men wounded, Mr. Stracey and Mr. Munzberg. How it was
that more men were not hit, I don't know, as the bullets
were pinging about pretty freely. Everyone, I think,
although I spread the men out as much as possible, had
some narrow shaves, and my Sergeant-Major got two bullets
through his gaiter, and one through his trousers between his
legs, yet he was not touched.</p>

<p class="i1">Not knowing how many Kafirs we had to deal with, nor
whether some of them would not try to get round in front
of us, I now sent Mr. Blöcker on with half the troop and
the wounded men to take up a position on ahead, on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
line of retreat; whilst Mr. Grenfell and I with the rest of
the men remained behind to keep the Kafirs from coming
out of the broken ground behind us. However, having lost
a few of their number, they showed no disposition to leave
the shelter of the rocks, so we retired slowly and off-saddled
on an open spot just beyond the hills.</p>

<p class="i1">The Kafirs with whom we had been engaged had been
for the most part, I think, members of the native police
force, as I had seen several myself who were wearing the
white knickerbocker trousers of the police uniform. They
all, too, seemed to be young men, and were shooting with
Winchester rifles; and did not shoot badly either—that is
for natives. It was most fortunate that neither of the two
men hit was mortally wounded, as if they had been we
should have found it very difficult to carry them. Mr.
Stracey was shot through the knee, though fortunately the
bone was not much shattered, so he not only did not lose his
leg, but will eventually, the doctor promises, have as good a
limb as ever. Mr. Munzberg, a young German, was hit in
the small of the back, and had a wonderful escape, as the
bullet struck a kind of chain belt he was wearing round his
waist. It went through this, but being much flattened out
lost its velocity, and only inflicted a deep flesh wound.</p>

<p class="i1">In some ways the Kafirs may be said to have had the
best of this encounter, as we left them in possession of the
field. However, whilst we lost no men, we left a few of
our opponents ready for burial, and our retreat, although it
was a retreat, was of the slowest and most orderly character.
Our horses were simply a nuisance to us amongst the
granite boulders, and we could have done much better
without them. Indeed, I saw enough this day to assure me
that all subsequent fighting in the Matopos would have to
be done on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">During the firing old Mazhlabanyan had behaved with great
coolness. At first, when we were driving the Kafirs from the
rocks above the cattle kraal, he had remained below holding
my horse, but after recrossing the stream, I told him to go
on with Mr. Blöcker. Finding that I did not immediately
follow, the old fellow seems to have got very nervous about
my safety, as after asking Mr. Blöcker a great many times
where his master was, he came back to look. However, old
Jack will be comfortably settled on my Company's land when
these troublous times are over, and when the rinderpest has
died out, and fresh cattle can be brought into the country, his
fidelity will not be forgotten. After an hour's rest we again
saddled up, and made straight across country to Dawson's
store, at the Umzingwani ford on the Tuli road, twenty-five
miles from Bulawayo. Here we were able to obtain a stretcher
on which to carry Mr. Stracey, Mr. Munzberg still being
able to ride.</p>

<p class="i1">As there could now be no doubt that there were hostile
Kafirs at no great distance, I advised Mr. Boyce, who was
in charge of the store, to lock up everything and accompany
us to Bulawayo, which he did.</p>

<p class="i1">We started at sundown, all of us taking it in turns to
carry our wounded comrade, and reached the post station,
twelve miles from Bulawayo, soon after midnight. Here we
passed a wretched night in the mule stable, as we were all
wet through, a soaking rain having come on about an hour
previously, which lasted for the rest of the night.</p>

<p class="i1">I sent two men on at once to Bulawayo, asking that a
cart and a doctor might be sent out for the wounded men
in the morning. The cart was sent, but no doctor could be
spared. However, by mid-day we reached Bulawayo, and the
wounded men were soon made comfortable in the hospital.</p>

</div>



<p class="chapsum">O'Connor's wonderful escape—The importance of the Native Question
in Rhodesia.</p>


<p><span class="sc">In</span> the course of conversation, during our journey to Bulawayo,
Mr. Boyce, the manager of Mr. Dawson's store on the Umzingwani,
told me that, on the night before our arrival there, a
miner named O'Connor had reached the store in a dreadful
condition, having been terribly beaten about the head by
Kafirs, from whose tender mercies he had escaped on 24th
March. This poor fellow had been sent in to the hospital
on the morning of the day on which we readied the store,
and as his escape was a most remarkable one, I will tell it
as I heard it from the man's own lips.</p>

<p class="i1">O'Connor, it appears, was engaged in mining work together
with two other miners named Ivers and Ottens, on a reef
called the Celtic, situated some mile and a half from Edkins'
store.</p>

<p class="i1">On the morning of Tuesday, 24th March, after their
early cup of coffee, the three miners were discussing matters
in general, and more particularly the fact that during the
last few days thirteen of their boys had run away for no
apparent reason, unless it were that they had gone off to
take part in a beer drink at the neighbouring kraal of
Gorshlwayo. About seven o'clock they had an early breakfast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and shortly afterwards Ottens went off to see the Native
Commissioner, Mr. Bentley, who was living at the police
camp not far from Edkins' store. Then Ivers went away
to see how the work was progressing at one of the shafts
on the Celtic reef, leaving O'Connor alone. He, after
kneading a loaf of bread and placing it in the sun to rise,
went into his hut, and sitting down on his bed, threw his
hat on a chair beside him, and lit his pipe. He had been
sitting smoking some few minutes, when he was suddenly
startled by the loud and angry barking of Ottens' dogs,
Captain and Snowball, just outside his hut. "The angry
condition of the dogs was so unusual," said O'Connor, "that
I give you my word I thought there was a lion in the camp."
Jumping up, he ran to the door of the hut, only to find a
Kafir standing just on one side of the entrance with a
musket pointed towards him in his hands. "For an instant,"
said O'Connor, "I was paralysed, and retreated back into
the hut, the door of which was immediately afterwards
blocked by a crowd of Kafirs all armed with heavy knob-kerries.
Then, seeing that they had come to murder me, I
became mad, and rushed in amongst them. I succeeded in
wresting two knob-kerries from them, and with these I fought
desperately, always making my way towards the mouth of
No. 1 shaft, which was something over 100 yards from my
hut. I was repeatedly knocked down, and heavy blows
were continually rained upon me, but, now on my knees,
again on my feet, and sometimes rolling, I got to the mouth
of the shaft with the remains of two broken sticks in my
hands."</p>

<p class="i1">During this desperate struggle, O'Connor remembers
hearing the Kafirs, who were attacking him with sticks, continually
calling to the one with the gun, <i>u injani wena ai posa</i>—"why
don't you shoot?"—and says that this man actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
fired at him more than once, holding his gun at his hip, and
always missing him. Just as he fell at the mouth of the
shaft he was fired at for the last time. Then O'Connor rolled
down the shaft "like a football," as he expressed it.</p>

<p class="i1">This was what is called an "incline shaft," going down
for 136 feet at an angle of about 45 degrees. From the bottom
of the incline shaft a tunnel had been driven into the reef
170 feet in length. Arrived at the bottom of the shaft, the
hapless miner was at once attacked by his own boys—ten in
number—who had been working in the tunnel. These devils
fell upon him with hammers and drills, O'Connor defending
himself as best he could with stones, and finally driving them
all, as he thought, up the shaft.</p>

<p class="i1">After the terrible punishment he had received, which
included thirteen scalp wounds—one of which had broken the
outer table of the skull above the left temple—heavy blows
with a hammer on each cheek-bone, and bruises and contusions
all over the body, it may be wondered how O'Connor
managed to retain his senses. But the fact remains that he
did, and, thanks to a good old Irish head, still lives to tell
the tale of the sufferings he endured, which, however, were
not yet over by any means.</p>

<p class="i1">Believing that all his assailants had left the mine, he
bethought him of a place of refuge, at a spot some half-way
up the incline, where a vertical shaft had been cut into it.
Here the shafts cut through some old workings, which formed
a recess, into which O'Connor crept. Just as he was about
to avail himself of this hiding-place, a Kafir, who, during the
last fight, must have run back down the tunnel, rushed past
him up the incline shaft. This man must have told the rest
of the would-be murderers where the white man was hiding,
and they did not leave him long in peace, for shortly afterwards
several Kafirs came down the shaft, some with lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
candles, and four with guns. Two of these men carried
muzzle-loaders, whilst the other two were armed with breech-loading
rifles. The latter O'Connor recognised by the light
of the candles as "boys" who had been working for himself
and his companions. Their names were "Candle," and
"Makupeni," and they had been in the employ of the miners
for nearly eighteen months, and as they were both good shots
they had often been sent out with the only two rifles in
camp to shoot game for the sake of the meat. Latterly, so
implicit was the trust reposed in them by their masters that
the rifles had been left entirely in their possession, but now
they were among the first to volunteer their services to put
an end to their employer in his sore extremity.</p>

<p class="i1">When O'Connor recognised his own trusted servants
amongst his assailants he spoke to them, asking what harm
he had done them, and why they wished to kill him, to which
they answered, "We're going to kill you and all the white
men in the country." However, although their would-be
victim could see them, they could not see him, and seemed
afraid to advance their heads into the recess where he lay—as
they would have had to do in order to shoot him—for
fear probably of being hit with a lump of quartz, which,
even though it had been gold-bearing, might have made a
nasty mark on their skulls.</p>

<p class="i1">During this time the Kafirs at the top of the shaft kept
continually calling out to those below with the guns, "What
are you doing; why don't you shoot the white man?" but
still the cowardly murderers lacked the courage to creep into
the recess and finish their victim. Suddenly there was a
commotion at the top of the mine, and shouts of "<i>Amakiwa</i>,
<i>Amakiwa</i>"—"white men, white men,"—and the four men
with guns, together with those who were holding the candles,
ran up the shaft, leaving the white man once more alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">This cry of "white men" must have been a false alarm,
as all the Europeans at the neighbouring police station and
at Edkins' store were murdered without offering any resistance,
having been taken completely by surprise. However, it gave
O'Connor a few minutes' respite and enabled him to gain the
shelter of another hiding-place where he thought he would
be more secure from the guns of his enemies. This was a
spot about half-way down the tunnel, where some loose
ground had fallen in and rendered a certain amount of
timbering necessary. Here, behind some boulders, O'Connor
took refuge, but his enemies having recovered from their
alarm and again come down the mine with candles, soon
found out, probably by his tracks, where he had hidden.
And now the fruits of education were brought to the aid of
native devilry to compass his destruction, for some of his
own boys threw two charges of dynamite with short fuses
into his hiding-place. Then the Kafirs all ran out of the
mine, nor did they return, thinking probably that they had
blown the white man to pieces. Having only seen the
wonderful effects of dynamite when employed for blasting
rocks and exploded at the bottom of a hole drilled deep into
solid stone, they did not know that a loose charge exploded
on the surface of the ground would have comparatively little
effect. However O'Connor, except that he was nearly
suffocated by the fumes of the dynamite, remained uninjured
in the shelter of the boulder behind which he lay. Shortly
after the explosions he thinks he must have become unconscious
and remained so for many hours. When he came to
himself, hearing no sound that betokened the proximity of
his enemies, he crept from his hiding-place, and made his
way to the mouth of the tunnel, and then ascended the
incline shaft.</p>

<p class="i1">It was a bright moonlight night, and from the position of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the moon he judged that it was about eight o'clock. A glance
showed him that his camp had been destroyed and all the huts
burnt down, but he could see no Kafirs about. He then made
his way to an old mining camp about one and a half miles
distant, called Nelson's Camp, from which he could look
down on the police station, which he still hoped to find in
the possession of white men. In the brilliant moonlight he
saw the huts still standing; but there was no life or movement
perceptible, and no lights or fires burning, and he
therefore felt assured that the whites had either been murdered
or left the camp. Then he went down to the stream which
ran between the police camp and Edkins' store, and as he
expressed it "wallowed in it like a pig."</p>

<p class="i1">After having quenched his thirst and washed the blood
from his wounds he carefully approached Edkins' store,
which he found had been burnt down, whilst the smell of
murder was in the air, and the deathlike stillness was unbroken
by even the bark of a dog. Then, indeed, the unfortunate
man recognised to the full all the terrors of his
dreadful position. All hope of succour from his immediate
neighbours was gone; they had all been killed or forced to
flee for their lives, whilst he stood alone amongst a nation of
murderers. But his stout Irish heart never quailed, and
weakened as he was by loss of blood he set out to the north-west,
towards Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">Leaving the Matabele kraal of Gorshlwayo as far as
possible to his left, he at length reached the Insiza river
some four miles from the camp he had left. By this time he
was completely exhausted, and lay down in the reeds on the
river's edge. Here he remained hidden all that night and
the next day. On Wednesday night he again tried to get on
towards Bulawayo, but by this time he was becoming more
or less light headed, and unable to steer a good course, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
does he know exactly where he wandered. He lay hidden
by day, and only moved at night, nor was it until Saturday
night at about eleven o'clock, more than 110 hours after he
had been attacked by the Kafirs, that he found his way to
Mr. Dawson's store on the Umzingwani river.</p>

<p class="i1">All this time he had had no food. On approaching the
store he found two men standing outside—Messrs. Schultz
and Judge—whom he knew well, but who had looked upon
him as dead. As he approached them in the moonlight,
hatless, his face and head covered with wounds, he thinks
they took him for an apparition come to call the white men
to avenge his murder, for they fell back as if they had seen
a ghost, and he said, "What, don't you know me—Joe
O'Connor?" Then as they rushed up and seized him by the
hands, he fell down senseless and they carried him to the
store. Mr. Judge at once rode in to Bulawayo to try and
get a doctor to come out and dress his wounds.</p>

<p class="i1">The following morning he was sent on by waggon from
the Umzingwani store, and was met half-way by Mr. Lyons,
the dispenser at the hospital, who, as no doctor could be
spared, had volunteered to go to the wounded man's assistance.
On Sunday afternoon he reached Bulawayo, where he lay a
long time in hospital. All that medical skill and kindly
nursing could do for him was done, and he eventually recovered
from the dreadful injuries he had received; but the
terrible experiences he has passed through have turned his
hair partially grey, he being a young man of only twenty-six
years of age. He has, too, to mourn the loss of his brother and
cousin, both of whom were murdered by the Matabele.</p>

    "As he approached them in the moonlight, hatless, his face and head covered with

	avenge his murder."</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">I was present in Colonel Napier's office, when a Zambesi
boy, who had been working for them, gave evidence as to the
manner in which they had been killed. He said, "I saw them
killed with my eyes; they were killed by their own boys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
O'Connor's brother was drawn up from the bottom of the
shaft in which he was working by two men, who held the
windlass still when his head came above the level of the
ground, whilst others beat his brains out with knob-kerries;
the other man—O'Connor's cousin—was stabbed to death
with assegais." I have made many inquiries concerning
O'Connor, and find that he bears the character of being a
hard-working man, whilst he was known to the Native Commissioner
of his district as one who always got on well with
the natives.</p>

<p class="i1">From some remarks which he made, however, subsequent
to the relation of his trying experiences, I judge that he has
now abandoned any latent intention he may ever have had of
becoming a member of the Aborigines Protection Society, nor
do I think that the funds of that admirable institution are
likely to be added to by any donation from Mr. O'Connor.</p>

<p class="i1">The worst feature in the foregoing history of the attempted
murder of O'Connor and the actual murder and mutilation of
his two companions, Messrs. Ivers and Ottens, is the participation
in the crimes by two trusted servants who had been in
the employ of the murdered men for so long a time as eighteen
months, since the very fact that these boys had worked for
so many months for the same white men shows conclusively
that they must have been kindly treated by them, for no
Kafir will remain long in the service of a master who ill-treats
him.</p>

<p class="i1">Now I am not so unreasonable as to think that the natures
of the Matabele natives ought to be judged of by the unamiable
qualities shown by two individuals; indeed I know
that as a set-off, even during the present rebellion, the lives
of some few white men have been saved by the fidelity of
natives in their employ. But unfortunately the evil deeds
get more noised abroad, and they add to the bitterness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
exasperation felt by the whites against the blacks; for it
seems inevitable that during an insurrection such as the
present, the average nature of the native will be judged of by
the average European on the spot, according to the worst
atrocities that have been committed, and such an instance of
treachery as I have related will harden the kindest heart and
produce a feeling of distrust in the whole race that can never
be eradicated from the mind. In many, too—and these by
no means the most brutal or worst educated in the community—such
acts, coupled with the indiscriminate murder of women
and children, produce a conviction that beings who are capable
of such deeds, who can lick your hand and fawn upon you for
eighteen months and then one day turn and murder you, and
afterwards perhaps mutilate your senseless corpse, are not
men and brothers, but monsters in human shape, that ought
to be shot down mercilessly like wild dogs or hyaenas, until
they are reduced to a state of abject submission to the white
man's rule.</p>

<p class="i1">In time, however, let us hope that the cruel deeds of the
last few months will be forgotten, and the fierce passions they
have evoked on both sides gradually smoulder out and die
from the lack of fresh fuel. Henceforth it will, I trust, be
recognised by the authorities that the native question in
Rhodesia is one of the very first importance, and that it is
also one which demands the most careful handling in order
to ensure the future peace and prosperity of the country.
When this rebellion is quelled and the natives have once
more submitted themselves to the white man's rule, they
must know exactly the terms on which their submission has
been accepted; and they must also understand precisely
what will be required of them in the shape of hut-tax, labour,
etc. Then if they are treated kindly and justly, as well as
firmly, they ought not to have any valid reason for again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
rebelling against the government of their white conquerors;
but lest they should ever be inclined to make such an attempt
without any valid reason, they must now be so thoroughly
and completely disarmed as to render any such action
futile.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE LAAGER IN THE MARKET SQUARE, BULAWAYO, APRIL 1896.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> our return to Bulawayo, we found that a very strong
laager had been formed in the large square round the Market
Buildings. Within this laager the whole population of the
town, with few exceptions, slept every night; the women
and children within the buildings, whilst the men manned
the waggons in readiness to resist any sudden attack.</p>

<p class="i1">The Bulawayo laager was probably the strongest ever
constructed in South Africa, and the whole Matabele nation,
I think, would never have taken it by assault. But if 2000
of them, or even a smaller number, had made a night attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
upon the town before the laager had been formed, I think it
more than probable that the entire white population would
have been massacred. It appears that there was a terrible
scare on the very night on which I had left the town for
Essexvale, viz. Wednesday, 25th March. This scare was
absolutely groundless and seems to have been caused by a
drunken man galloping about calling out "The Matabele are
here; the Matabele are here."</p>

<p class="i1">My wife was resting in Mrs. Spreckley's house at the time,
being much fatigued by her long ride in the hot sun from
Essexvale. However, she and her kind hostess, as well as all
the other ladies living on the suburban stands, were hurried
over to the new Club-house, nearly a mile distant, in the
centre of the town. Here the large number of women and
children in Bulawayo, many of them hastily summoned from
their beds, and most of them terribly frightened, passed a
miserable night all huddled up together, but getting neither
rest nor sleep, as they were constantly kept on the <i>qui vive</i>
by fresh rumours, all equally groundless, as happily at this
time there was no force of hostile natives within twenty
miles of Bulawayo. On the following day the laager
was formed, and by the time I got back to town Colonel
Spreckley and Mr. Scott (the town major) had, after an
immense amount of hard work, got everything into good
order.</p>

<p class="i1">These two gentlemen deserve the utmost credit not only
for getting the laager into good order, but also for keeping it
in that condition for the next two months. Major Scott was
indefatigable in looking after the sanitary arrangements,
whilst Colonel Spreckley, by his genial good nature, backed
by great common sense and strength of character, kept all the
various human elements shut up in that confined space not
only in good order but in good humour. Nobody in Bulawayo, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
I think, could have performed the very difficult duties
required from the chief officer in charge of the laager so ably
as Colonel Spreckley during the first two months of the insurrection,
and his conduct was all the more admirable
because he was carrying out a very arduous and harassing
duty against his inclination, or rather burning desire, to be
out of town at the head of a patrol doing active work against
the insurgents.</p>

  <div class="caption">COLONEL J. A. SPRECKLEY.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Soon after my arrival in town, I was delighted to meet
the Native Commissioner of my district, Mr. Jackson, whom I
had never thought to see again. He and his white companions 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
had received warning of the rising from his sub-inspector,
and were also cautioned lest there should be a plot
on foot for their murder by the native police. At this time,
however, the ninety men they had with them, each of whom
was armed with a Winchester rifle and seventy rounds of
ammunition, did not know that the rebellion had commenced,
and they managed to bring them all in to Bulawayo without
any trouble, where they were at once disarmed.</p>

<p class="i1">Now by this time it had become evident that the insurrection
had become general throughout the length and
breadth of Matabeleland, and I will give a brief account of
what had happened so far as is known.</p>

<p class="i1">I have already related that Mr. Cumming and another
man brought the first news of the murders of white men in
the Insiza district to Bulawayo. On reaching Lee's store,
twenty-four miles from the town, they found that their horses
were completely knocked up, and they could thus only have
proceeded on foot, had not Mr. Claude Grenfell just happened
to be passing the store with a cart and horses on his way from
Gwelo to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">On hearing the alarming news Mr. Grenfell took Mr.
Cumming on with him at once to headquarters, his companion,
Mr. Edmunds, giving up his seat to him, and walking.
Before reaching Lee's store, Mr. Grenfell had met Mr. George
Grey, travelling alone in a Cape cart with a coloured boy, on
his way to inspect some of his mining properties near the
Tchangani river, and when the news of the murders in the
Insiza district became known, much anxiety was naturally
felt concerning Mr. Grey's safety, as well as that of all other
Europeans who were living at a distance from Bulawayo in
mining camps or on lonely farms.</p>

<p class="i1">Early on Thursday morning, however, Mr. Grey returned
to town, having escaped death by the merest chance, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
must only just have escaped falling into the hands of more
than one party of murderers.</p>

<p class="i1">On reaching the Pongo store some twelve miles from the
Tchangani river, Mr. Grey had found all the outhouses just
burnt. The store itself seemed to have been looted, but was
not at this time burnt down. No trace of the owners could
be found, but the ground was thickly covered with the naked
footprints of natives, and, more ominous still, a large pool of
blood was seen in the road in front of the store. We now
know that at this time the recently-murdered corpses of three
white men were lying, two of them close to the store, and
the third on the top of a rise a short distance away. I was
present some six weeks later when the bodies were discovered
and buried. The unfortunate men must have been suddenly
attacked with knob-kerries and axes, as their skulls had all
been smashed in. In this instance the clothes were not
removed from the bodies.</p>

<p class="i1">This was the first intimation that Mr. Grey got that
mischief was brewing in the country. Soon after passing the
Pongo store, he turned off the main road and went down to
the Eagle mine some four miles distant. This he found had
been only recently deserted by the Europeans employed there,
and with his suspicions now fully aroused he returned at once
to the main road, and made for the Tchangani store. On his
way there he came across a white man on the roadside, who
had escaped from a party of Kafirs, after receiving two severe
battle-axe wounds, one of which had cut his face open from
nose to ear, whilst the second had cut his arm to the bone
and severed all the tendons of the wrist. This man had been
working with two companions on a farm in the neighbourhood,
when on the previous day—Tuesday, 24th March—they had
been suddenly and without any warning attacked by a party
of Kafirs armed with knob-kerries and battle-axes. Although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
two of them were wounded, they managed to retreat to their
hut, on which the natives, probably thinking that they had
firearms there, retired.</p>

<div class="caption ac p2">Those numbers refer to the four gentlemen with

  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">After sundown the three white men left their hut, intending
to make for Stewart's store at the Tekwe. Unfortunately
it was a bright moonlight night, and the Kafirs must have
been watching them, as they immediately followed, and
chased them into a maize field, through which they hunted
them. During this pursuit the white men became separated.
One of them reached Mr. Stewart's store in safety; the second,
Mr. Scott by name, found his way to the road near the Pongo
store and was picked up and taken to the Tchangani by Mr.
Grey; but the third must have fallen into the hands of the
Kafirs, and, of course, been murdered, as he has never again
been heard of from that day to this. The man who made his
way to the Tekwe had received a severe blow on the head
with a knob-kerry.</p>

<p class="i1">Arrived at the Tchangani, Mr. Grey found seventeen
Europeans in laager there, amongst them the men from the
Eagle mine, who had been pursued on their way to the store.
The natives, however, were afraid to come to close quarters with
them as they were armed with rifles, and at this time the rebels
in this district had not yet dug up the firearms which they had
buried after the war of 1893, and were therefore only able
to kill white men whom they could take by surprise with
knob-kerries and axes.</p>

<p class="i1">Now fully realising the very serious aspect of affairs, Mr.
Grey, instead of remaining in the shelter of the laager, most
pluckily determined to return to Bulawayo at once, making
use of the post mules along the road, in order to warn all
people with as little delay as possible that the Kafirs had
risen.</p>

<p class="i1">A few hours after he had left the Tchangani, the garrison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the laager was augmented by the arrival of Messrs.
Farquhar, Weston Jarvis, Currie, and Mr. Egerton (M.P. for
Knutsford) and his son. These gentlemen had been on a
hunting trip to the Sebakwe river, and were returning to
Bulawayo only just in time, as had they remained out in the
veld any longer they would certainly have been murdered,
for although they would doubtless have given a very good
account of themselves, yet a few men cannot fight an army.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following day—Thursday, 26th March—two small
patrols were organised and sent out from the Tchangani, one
of which, consisting of Mr. Mowbray Farquhar and two companions,
visited a mine where a white man was known to
have been working a day or two previously, whilst the other,
consisting of Mr. Robinson and two others, visited the Pongo
store and the Eagle mine. A careful search was made by
the latter all round the store, and the bodies of two out of
the three men who had been murdered there two days previously
were discovered and covered with blankets, which
were still in their places when we buried the remains some
six weeks later. The third corpse they did not find, as it was
lying some distance from the store.</p>

<p class="i1">Mr. Farquhar and his two companions visited Comployer's
camp, and found the unfortunate man lying murdered in
front of the door of his hut. They tried to get on to Gracey's
camp, but could not do so for fear of being surrounded and
cut off by the Kafirs, who were all in their kraals watching
them. It has since been ascertained that Gracey was
murdered on the same day as Comployer.</p>

<p class="i1">On returning to the laager, they found that a mule-waggon
had been sent from Gwelo, with orders from the
officer commanding there that all Europeans should come
in as quickly as possible to assist in the defence of the town
against the Kafirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Leaving the Tchangani at 5 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> on Thursday evening,
the whole party reached Gwelo in safety on Friday morning
at half-past eight. In the meantime Mr. Grey, travelling at
express speed with relays of coach mules, reached Bulawayo
early on Thursday morning. On passing the Tekwe store,
he found assembled there Mr. Stewart, five other white men,
and two women, who were endeavouring to fortify a hut.
Promising them speedy relief, Mr. Grey hurried on to warn
others of their danger, but beyond the Tekwe he found that
the occupants of the roadside hotels and post stations had
already taken the alarm and made their way to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">On Thursday, 26th March, Mr. Grey got together twenty-three
good men, and started back for the Tekwe that same
evening. These men formed the nucleus of a force which
has done splendid service in the suppression of the present
rebellion, under the name of Grey's Scouts. They were a
picked body of men, and neither their name nor their brave
deeds will ever be forgotten in Rhodesia, whilst I think we all
regard Captain Grey as one of the finest specimens of an
Englishman in the country—quiet, self-contained and unassuming,
but at the same time, brave, capable, and energetic.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Captain Grey</span> and his men reached Tekwe store about 2
<span class="sc">P.M.</span>
on Friday, 27th March, and were only just in time to save
the beleaguered whites there; for shortly before their arrival
a party of Kafirs had driven off all Mr. Stewart's cattle, and
killed a horse belonging to him. At the same time they had
been kind enough to send him a message by the boy who
had been looking after his cattle, to the effect that they
meant to return and kill all the white people that night.
However, they made no attack when they found that Mr.
Stewart's small party had been reinforced by some twenty
well-armed men.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following day Colonel Napier's column, which had
left Bulawayo on the previous Tuesday, and had been patrolling
the country in the direction of the Insiza river, came
across country to the Tekwe store. Besides saving the lives
of Mr. Stewart and his party, the presence of Colonel Napier
and Captain Grey with the men under their command on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the Salisbury road at this juncture was the means of saving
the lives of nine other white men and two coloured boys, the
latter being the drivers, whilst the former were the guard, sent
down with the last mail coach from Gwelo.</p>

<p class="i1">This coach left Gwelo on Saturday, 28th March, arriving at
the Tchangani early the following morning. Here they found
the body of a white man, just murdered and stripped stark
naked, lying in the middle of the road in front of the store.
This was the body of a prospector named Wood in the employ
of Willoughby's Consolidated Company, who had come across
country from the Selukwe district. Unfortunately he arrived
at the Tchangani store on the day after it had been evacuated
by the white men who had been in laager there, and he
probably found it in possession of the Kafirs, who of course
murdered him.</p>

<p class="i1">On seeing this ghastly sign of the times, the men in
charge of the coach determined to drive on at once without
outspanning, and soon observed Kafirs running in the bush
and keeping pace with the coach on both sides of the road.
These natives, however, seemed to have no guns, and by continually
firing at them the white men kept them from coming
to close quarters. After a time the Pongo store was reached,
but no halt was possible owing to the threatening attitude of
the Kafirs. The mules were now almost done up, and could
only get the coach along at a walk, but still the Kafirs hung
on either flank, as thirsty for blood as a pack of wild dogs
awaiting the moment to rush in upon a wounded buffalo.</p>

<p class="i1">Some three miles farther on the poor mules came to a
standstill, and the white men were forced to leave the coach,
and keep on on foot along the road, the Kafirs ever keeping
pace with them in the bush on either side, and doubtless
only waiting for the darkness of night to enable them to
rush in and kill them with as little loss to themselves as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
possible. But just at dusk they reached Colonel Napier's
column in a very exhausted condition.</p>

<p class="i1">Some six weeks later, when we found the bodies of the
men who had been murdered at the Pongo store, we also
found some three miles on this side of the store the coach
which had been captured by the Kafirs. A linch-pin had
been removed, and one of the wheels taken off. The pole
had also been sawn in two, and all the mail bags cut open,
their contents being scattered all over the ground. The poor
mules had all been stabbed to death with assegais, and lay in
a heap together, still in their harness.</p>

<p class="i1">Altogether the combined patrols under Colonel Napier
and Captain Grey collected and brought back with them to
Bulawayo forty-three persons, including two women and a
child, many, if not all of whom, had they not been thus timely
rescued, would have fallen victims to the Kafirs. The names
of the poor fellows murdered at the Pongo store are Frederick
Hurlstone, J. Beddington, and H. Zeeburg. At midnight on
the Saturday before my return to Bulawayo from the Matopo
Hills, Captain Pittendrigh of the Africander Corps had left
town with a small party only eleven strong, in order first of
all to reinforce for the night a small party at Jenkins' store,
and then push on some thirty miles farther, in order to relieve
Mr. Graham, the native commissioner at Inyati, who with
Sub-inspector Hanley and five other white men was believed
to be in laager there. There were many volunteers for this
expedition, but as the Government was unable to furnish
them with horses or rifles, only those could go who were in a
position to equip themselves.</p>

<p class="i1">Jenkins' store was reached at half-past two on Sunday
morning. Here ten men were found in laager, including a
younger brother of Mr. Graham the native commissioner.
He, with an assistant native commissioner, Mr. Carter, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
cart and four mules and two spare horses, had been on his
way to Inyati to bring his brother, who was suffering from
an attack of fever, into Bulawayo. As an attack had been
expected on the store that night, the thatch had been removed
from the roof, and a rough fence put up round the building.
However, no attack was made, and at 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> the whole party,
now consisting of nineteen men, with the two spare horses
and the cart and mules driven by two colonial boys, set out
for the Bembisi,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> twenty-three miles distant.</p>

<p class="i1">For the subsequent experiences of this small rescue party,
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Moodie Thomson, the
able editor of the <i>Matabele Times</i>, who accompanied Captain
Pittendrigh and wrote an account of the expedition. This
he has kindly placed at my disposal, and I will take up his
narrative at the point when the start was made from Jenkins'
store early on Sunday morning. It proceeds as follows:—</p>

<p class="i1">"We were now in a very different country from the open
veld of the earlier ride. Kopjes were close on either hand,
the road was of the roughest, and progress with the mule
cart consequently slow. The word was constantly given for
a good look-out on either hand, but for over an hour not a
man or a woman was seen, though tracks crossing the path
were met with at frequent intervals. The kopjes in which
we had expected to have trouble were passed, and the more
open undulating ground at the Elibaini Hills reached. Progress
was slow along this portion of the ascending road, and
near the highest point skirting the base of the most prominent
hill a strip of bush was entered. No sooner had we
made our way into this cover than a shot was heard from
the hill-slope. In a second it was seen to be occupied by
half a dozen or so natives, who sent in another and another
shot. It was impossible to make a sufficient reply from our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
position, and a dash was made from the road through the
strip of bush to the open slope of the hill. One or more of
the natives was shot as they retreated over the crest, and a
hot pursuit was made.</p>

<p class="i1">"When those of our party who were foremost reached
the top of the hill they found that affairs had assumed a
different aspect from repulsing a handful of stray rebels. A
glance was sufficient. The natives were there in a dense
mass, throwing out skirmishers on either flank to surround
us, one body proceeding rapidly around the lower slope to
cut us off. Our advance men fell back, and the natives began
to show themselves in the open. Firing became hot on both
sides, but taking advantage of the strip of bush we were able
at first to inflict considerable damage. The natives to the
number of about three hundred were soon in the bush also,
advancing in excellent open order and becoming formidable.
Several rushed in to close quarters, and Captain Pittendrigh,
who had dismounted, lost his horse. Before he could get
one of the spare horses, a native armed with an assegai
grappled him, and a hand-to-hand struggle took place. The
native, however, was thrown off and shot, and the captain
escaped with some slits in his coat. At the same moment
Thomas Haden, who had been fighting most determinedly in
the front, received a shot on the upper part of his bandoleer,
which exploded three of his cartridges, one bullet passing
through his shoulder and with a ricochet entering his neck
and passing through his cheek. Immediately after Mr. S.
Carter received a bullet through his ankle. The natives
began to approach closer in their attack despite our heavy
fire, and as they were gradually surrounding us, it was found
advisable, encumbered as we were with two wounded men, to
retire to the road.</p>

<p class="i1">"With a rush through without further casualty on our side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
we regained the road and found that one of our boys at the
mule waggon had vanished, and the other was getting away
on one of the spare horses. The mules and cart had therefore
to be abandoned, and at a good pace we cut across through
the lower bush over rough ground, avoiding the curve round
the hills, to where the road bent round on the open.</p>

<p class="i1">"Here half-sections were again formed, the wounded in
front, and a quick canter gave us a good start. Looking
back, the natives could be seen in hot pursuit, and it was
thought they might be able to reach one of the kopjes ahead
whose base we must skirt. Suggestions as to taking up a
position on a kopje were untenable on account of the wounded
men, and there was nothing for it but to get over the seventeen
miles to the Bembisi as rapidly as possible. Again and again
the natives seemed to be closing up on us, and sundry indications
were closely scrutinised as to the presence of hostile
forces ahead. The ride was made heavier by two of the
ponies becoming done up. It was an anxious time, as the
road ran through the hollows, but the clearness of the day
gave abundant scope for noting the absence of an enemy
ahead and the black mass falling farther astern.</p>

<p class="i1">"About eleven o'clock Campbell's store came in sight, and
we crossed the Bembisi with gladdened spirits. These, however,
were immediately damped. The news was awaiting us
that the party at Inyati, eight miles farther on, which we had
been sent to relieve, had been massacred. The intelligence
was given by Patrick Madden, miner, who, and a native in
his employ, were the sole survivors. This man told with
most circumstantial and convincing detail how Native Commissioner
Graham, Inspector Hanley, George Hurford, George
Case, and S. H. Corke had fought against ever-increasing
odds on the evening of the previous Friday—this was now
Sunday—until they were killed. Madden, another miner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
named Tim Donovan, and a colonial native had made for the
hills, and after two days' hiding Madden and the native had
reached this store.</p>

<p class="i1">"The narrative, it may be said, has been fully corroborated
since from other sources, with the addition that Donovan was
also pursued and killed. Further, there was the news that
an impi of from 1200 to 1500 lay at Inyati. It was hard to
decide to abandon the projected relief, but the facts were
obvious that with an impi ahead, and with a body of 300 at
least following us, and very shortly seen to be in the bush
across the river, there was nothing for it but to take up the
strongest position possible.</p>

<p class="i1">"Across the river the natives could be seen in the bush,
and were we even to venture with our wounded to go by the
road, we were at their mercy. At the store we had found
Mr. Campbell with a waggon and oxen, hourly expecting to
be pounced upon, and it was resolved to set to work to fortify
the store. The verandah thatch was cut away, passages were
pierced so that there might be free communication through
the large building, and loopholes were cut through the brick
walls in every direction. In addition, a case of dynamite
was found in the store which was utilised to lay mines with
ingeniously-contrived short fuse, and to make a score or so
hand grenades with a radius of about fifteen yards that could
be thrown at assailants. The large stock of meal in sacks
was put into service to block windows, and then we were
certain that, having about 2000 rounds of ammunition, we
could hold out well against a night attack.</p>

<p class="i1">"It was necessary, however, to send word to Bulawayo of
our condition and the intelligence we had received, and to
obtain reinforcements which we calculated could arrive in
time to fall on the rear of the natives attacking us at daybreak.
Messrs. Fincham and Mostert were mounted on the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
horses as despatch-riders. A diversion was made by the
whole party crossing the river as if returning by the road we
had come, and as we saw the natives moving to meet us the
despatch-riders went off at an angle by the Queen's Reef
road, passing the Shiloh Hills. The rest of the day was
spent in completing our fortifications. Strong guard was set
at night, and we waited eagerly for the natives to come for
the reception prepared for them. The wounded had been
bandaged and made as comfortable as possible; the horses
were stabled in the bar and store-room, and every man was
at his post carefully looking out.</p>

<p class="i1">"About four on Monday morning the silence was broken
by the sound of firing, and speculation was rife as to its
meaning. It came nearer and nearer, and it was soon decided
that this was the reinforcing party fighting its way through
the natives lying in wait for us. There was silence for a
time, broken again by the cracking of shots, and with the dim
dawn we could see a body of men emerging from the thick
bush. As they came nearer it became plain that they were
white men, and we left the store to send up a cheer to let
them know we were still safe. As day came more brightly,
in they rode across the open veld, and with answering cheers
dashed up the river-bank to the store. They were thirty
strong, fifteen from the Africander Corps under Commandant
Van Rensburg and Captain Van Niekerk, and the remainder
from various Rhodesia Horse Volunteers, troops or volunteers
under Captain Macfarlane. They had ridden the whole night
through, with only a brief halt at the Queen's Reef, and in
our vicinity had been met in the black darkness of the bush
with a volley fired not twenty yards off. They had replied,
and a running fire had been kept up for about half an hour.
No one in the party had been wounded, but two men in the
advanced guard, Messrs. Celliers and Henderson, were missing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Several dead bodies of natives seen in the bush testified later
to the effect of the replying fire.</p>

<p class="i1">"About nine o'clock it was decided that the whole party
should return by the Queen's Reef road and ride straight for
Bulawayo. A start was made with strong flanking parties,
Captain Pittendrigh's men being placed in the rear-guard
after the waggon containing our two wounded. Cautious
progress was made through the bush where the natives had
been assembled and where spoor was thick, but without a
sign of life visible. The Queen's Reef was reached about
eleven o'clock, and at noon the column got again into dangerous
bush.</p>

<p class="i1">"Nothing occurred, however, until the Shiloh Hills were
reached, when on the spur of a kopje and in the bush below
natives were seen. They opened fire, but their aim was high.
Those of them who were venturous enough to make the attack
were summarily disposed of—nothing being more convincing
of the perfection of the fire of our party than the manner in
which seven, eight, or nine shots would simultaneously bowl
over a native who exposed himself even for a moment. On
our side a horse—one of Mr. Zeederberg's finest animals—was
shot through the lower part of the stomach, and subsequently
died from the effects of the wound. This was our
only casualty, and on the other side there must have been a
loss of a dozen men at least. The fire was fairly hot while it
lasted, but a party of about fifty was too strong for the
natives, even though they may have been several hundred.
They had to depend upon their firing, as close quarters against
such marksmen was almost an impossibility.</p>

<p class="i1">"The Kotki river was reached after a heavy detour through
the bush to avoid giving the natives around us too much
opportunity at the kopjes, and a halt made for an hour.
Just before reaching there a herd of native cattle had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
met and seized, and heifer steaks cooked on ramrods proved
refreshing after our twenty-mile ride at ox-waggon pace.
Then on again, the remaining fifteen miles without further
attack, until in the darkness a cheer from the pickets about
ten o'clock announced that Bulawayo had been reached.</p>

<p class="i1">"The wounded were conveyed to the hospital, and tired
horses and men had the satisfaction of seeking what comfort
was available in a laagered town. The men in Captain
Pittendrigh's party who had this experience of Matabele
skirmishing, were, with one or two additional exceptions,
members of the Africander Corps. It is useful to testify
that their courage, their determination, their skill with the
rifle, and their expert employment of every ruse in such
fighting as we had at the Elibaini Hills, command the
highest admiration. We were in a fairly tight place, as
may be judged when hand-to-hand fighting was possible, and
we were only nineteen against several hundreds; but the
pluck and brilliant dash displayed, as well as the good
comradeship throughout, are convincing that in a like or
even a stiffer affray one could neither wish nor hope to have
better men than these. It remains to be said that the two
missing men came in to Bulawayo on Wednesday morning.
Celliers had had his horse shot under him and was himself
badly wounded in the knee. With that consideration which
is akin to heroism Henderson placed him on his horse, and
walking beside him for three days they had hidden amongst
the hills, making their way through most dangerous country.
Henderson tended his wounded comrade in every way
possible, and succeeded in keeping clear of natives, though
at times they passed in unpleasantly close proximity.
Such conduct is something more than typical of the men who
are bent upon holding Matabeleland."</p>

<p class="i1">The devoted courage shown by Mr. Henderson in giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
up his own horse to his wounded comrade and sticking to
him for three days, during the whole of which time they
were surrounded by the enemy, and in continual danger
of being discovered, appears to me to be as brave a deed as
has yet been chronicled in the annals of Rhodesia. I commend
it to the notice of Mr. Labouchere, as I feel sure
that it will be quite a revelation to him to learn that there
exists amongst the "Buccaneers"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> at least one man who has
shown himself capable of a self-sacrificing and generous
act. Yet all Mr. Henderson's gallantry could not save his
comrade's life, as Mr. Celliers eventually died from the
effects of the amputation of his leg, owing principally to
the length of time which had elapsed between the time
when he was wounded and the date when the operation
was performed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Besides</span> the patrols of which I have already spoken that
were sent out from Bulawayo during the first days of the
insurrection, I must not forget that which was taken down
to the Gwanda district by Mr. James Dawson. Mr. Dawson,
who has lived amongst the natives of Matabeleland for many
years, and both speaks their language and understands their
character well, could not believe that a general rising
throughout the country was possible, and even after hearing
of the murders in the Insiza and Filibusi districts, and my
own report as to what had taken place on Essexvale, imagined
that the disturbance was only local. However, in order to
assure himself of the true position of affairs, he got together
some ten or twelve men, and leaving Bulawayo with them
on Wednesday night, 25th March, proceeded down the Tuli
road to his own store at "Amanzi minyama," situated in
the Gwanda district, and distant about seventy-five miles
from Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">On his way there he found everything perfectly quiet
along the road, all the wayside stores being still in the occupation 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of their owners, none of whom had heard anything
about the native rising—a state of things which of course
confirmed Mr. Dawson in his scepticism.</p>

<p class="i1">On the return journey, however, shortly before reaching
Spiro's store, which is distant thirty-seven miles from Bulawayo,
the fresh tracks of numbers of natives—men, women, and
children—as well as of cattle, goats, and sheep, were noticed
crossing the road. These were doubtless the trails made by
the Matabele from the Filibusi district, who were making
their way to the Matopo Hills, and at once aroused
suspicion.</p>

<p class="i1">Spiro's store was reached on Sunday, a few hours after
I had left it the same morning on my way into the hills.
Here Mr. Dawson found no one, for after my departure the
boys who had been looking after the coach mules became
frightened and took them in to Bulawayo, leaving the cattle
behind; and these were still in the kraal, with no one to
tend them, when Mr. Dawson passed. Not quite liking the
look of things, the patrol went on beyond the store, and slept
some four miles away from it.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning early they reached the wayside
hotel at the Umzingwani river, which we had left at
sundown on the evening before. Here in one of the huts
were found the blood-stained shirt of Mr. Munzberg, and also
a sock soaked with blood that had been taken from Mr.
Stracey. During Monday Mr. Dawson and his men remained
at the Umzingwani, but sent messengers to Bulawayo to
obtain news as to what was going on.</p>

<p class="i1">Late that evening an answer was received requesting him
to come on to town at once, as the Kafirs were reported to be
massing in the neighbourhood. Before this there had been
several alarms, and it was believed that natives were on the
watch round about the store. Thus when the start was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
made for Bulawayo, the lights were left burning, in order to
make the Kafirs believe that some of the party were still in
the house. Arrived at the river some 600 yards distant
from the store, Mr. Dawson rode back alone to reconnoitre,
but hearing natives talking, retired and rejoined his men.</p>

<p class="i1">Early on Tuesday morning Inspector Southey was met
with a small force at the head of the pass leading down to
the Umzingwani. He had been sent out to escort the
coach to Bulawayo, which was now some time overdue from
Tuli. However, as Mr. Dawson had heard nothing of this
coach, it was thought that it must have turned back; so
Inspector Southey, who had been ordered not to descend
the pass, returned to town, where shortly after his arrival
the coach turned up too without an escort.</p>

<p class="i1">This was the last coach that ran on the Tuli road, and
it seems to have been missed by the natives by a miracle,
as they had broken into the Umzingwani store and gone
away again in the interval between the time of its arrival
there and Mr. Dawson's departure.</p>

<p class="i1">This coach reached Bulawayo on the morning of Tuesday,
31st March, and on the same day—the day after my
own return from the Matopos—I was asked to take a patrol
of twenty-five men down the Mangwe road, in order to
ascertain if it was still clear, as a coach loaded with rifles
and ammunition and ten waggon-loads of provisions were
on their way up.</p>

<p class="i1">We left town about 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, each man carrying three days'
rations with him, and reaching Mabukitwani, twenty miles
distant from Bulawayo, the same night, arrived at "Fig Tree"
by noon the following day, where we found a store and mule
stable in charge of Mr. Elliott.</p>

<p class="i1">The people living in the neighbourhood are nearly all of
Makalaka descent, and have taken no part in the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
insurrection. At the time of my visit they were in a great
state of alarm, and the greater part of them had left their
villages and fled into the hills, fearing lest the white men
should visit the sins of the insurgents upon them. I therefore
sent one of Mr. Elliott's boys to call the principal Induna
to come and see me. With this man, an intelligent-looking
Makalaka named Jackal, who bears a striking resemblance
to the chief Khama, I had a long interview, and finally persuaded
him to send messengers to the refugees ordering
them to return to their kraals. Jackal assured me that the
first news of the rebellion was brought to him by the son of
Umfaizella (the brother of Lo Bengula, who with Umlugulu
and others is responsible for the murders at Edkins' store),
who was sent by his father to incite some of the Makalaka
to revolt. When he found that Jackal's people did not seem
very anxious to assist the Matabele in their attempt to
regain their independence, he said to him, "You say that
your people don't want to fight; that they wish to sit still.
Don't you know that the white men are killing all the black
men they can catch? Don't you know that they have shot
Gambo through the head, and thrown his body to the birds?
Have you not heard that every Kafir boy who was working
in Bulawayo has had his throat cut?" "I did not believe
him," said Jackal, "and soon afterwards one of my own
men, who had been working in town, came home, and told
me that the white men had killed no one in Bulawayo except
a few Matabele spies. Then I knew that the son of Umfaizella
had lied to me, but still the bad news frightened my
people." I may here state that Jackal expressed the opinion
that if they were unable to kill all the white men, a large
section of the Matabele would probably leave the country
with as many cattle as they could get together, and seek a
new home beyond the Zambesi. What amount of truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
there may be in this view, and how far the original plan may
have been modified owing to the destruction of all the
cattle by the rinderpest, remains to be seen. At present,
however, no section of the tribe seems actually to have made
a move beyond the outskirts of Matabeleland proper.</p>

<p class="i1">In the afternoon we proceeded to the Shashani. Before
reaching "Fig Tree," the coach, loaded with ammunition, had
passed us on its way to Bulawayo in charge of the escort that
had accompanied it from Mangwe. As, according to the information
I had received before leaving town, the convoy of
waggons ought now to have been close at hand, and I did not
wish to tire all my horses by taking them any farther than
necessary down the road, I left Lieutenant Grenfell in charge
of the patrol at the deserted shanty, which had done duty as
an hotel, near to which we had off-saddled, and rode on alone.</p>

<p class="i1">Shortly before reaching the Shashani hotel we had met a
light waggonette drawn by a team of horses on its way to
Bulawayo. In it were two gentlemen, Captain Lumsden (late
of the 4th Battalion Scottish Rifles) and Mr. Frost, on their
way to Matabeleland on a shooting expedition. We halted
and gave one another the news from up and down country
respectively, and had a laugh and a joke about the kind of
shooting one was likely to get in Matabeleland at the present
time. When Captain Lumsden got out of the waggonette I
saw what a fine specimen of a man he was—tall and broad-shouldered,
with a pleasant face and keen blue eye—and I
little thought that when next I met him, only a week later,
it would be in the Bulawayo hospital, where, poor fellow, he
lay with a leg shattered by a Kafir's bullet, on what soon
proved to be his deathbed, for he died from the effects of the
subsequent amputation of the limb.</p>

<p class="i1">After leaving my men I rode quietly on, but only met the
waggons I was looking out for when close to Mangwe. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
many friends in the laager there, I determined to ride a little
farther and pay them a visit. First, however, I exhorted the
man in charge of the waggons to push on at once, as I was
anxious to return to Bulawayo as soon as possible, in the hope
of getting something more exciting to do there than escorting
waggons.</p>

<p class="i1">When still some three miles from Mangwe I met a party
of horsemen riding towards me along the road. They proved
to be old friends who had come out to meet me, as they had
heard by telegraph that I was coming their way. Amongst
them was one of my oldest and most esteemed friends,
Cornelius Van Rooyen, with whom in the good old days I
had wandered and hunted for months together over the then
unknown wilds of Mashunaland.</p>

<p class="i1">Arrived at the laager, I received a very warm welcome
from both Dutch and English. Major Armstrong was in
command, whom, though a very young man, I thought both
shrewd and capable, and the excellent service he has done for
the Government during the present insurrection has, I think,
been fully recognised.</p>

<p class="i1">Before leaving Bulawayo I had heard it said that in the
Mangwe laager order and discipline were conspicuous by their
absence; but this I did not find to be at all the case. On
the contrary, it seemed to me that Major Armstrong and
Commandant Van Rooyen, by the exercise of great tact, had
between them got everything into excellent order; and this
is no small praise, for it must be remembered that the occupants
of the Mangwe laager belonged to two nationalities,
Dutch and English, each of which has its own way of doing
things, and the two can only be brought to work harmoniously
together by the exercise of both forbearance and good
sense on the part of the officer commanding the combined
force.</p>

<p class="i1">All my Dutch friends at Mangwe had suffered terrible
losses amongst their stock from the rinderpest; indeed, some
who had been rich men a couple of months before, possessing
several hundred head of stock, had now scarcely a beast left.
All along the road, too, from Bulawayo to Mangwe the evidences
of the ruthless severity of this plague were most lamentable.
Hundreds of carcasses in every stage of putrefaction everywhere
lined the track, whilst here and there were groups of
empty waggons abandoned by their owners, who, having lost
their means of livelihood through the death of their oxen, had
left the rest of their property standing uncared for in the
wilderness, and walked away ruined men.</p>

<p class="i1">At Wilson's farm, six miles from Bulawayo, where herds
of infected cattle had been slaughtered in the hopeless
endeavour to stamp out the disease, acres of carcasses were
lying festering in the sun, and any one passing along the road
did not require to look at them to know they were there.
Strangely enough, in spite of the exceptional opportunities
offering for free meals throughout Matabeleland at this time,
not a vulture was to be seen. I have heard it said that too
hearty an indulgence in rinderpest meat in the early days of
the plague killed all the vultures, and whether this is so or
not, certain it is that these useful birds are now as scarce as
cows in Matabeleland.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leaving</span> Mangwe on 2nd April, I rejoined my men on the
following day, and we then escorted the convoy of waggons
to Bulawayo, where we arrived early on the morning of
Saturday, 4th April.</p>

<p class="i1">Before reaching Bulawayo, I had heard that a Greek
trader had been murdered in the Bulilima district, near the
Maitengwe river, and this news was confirmed by the Rev.
Mr. Reed and Assistant Native Commissioner Gordon, both
of whom had been stationed in the same district, and both of
whom owe their escape to the fact that they received notice
from friendly natives that their lives were in danger. Mr.
Gordon was informed by his own native police that a Matabele
Induna, named Langabi, had given orders to his people
to kill him, and they not only warned him of his danger, but
escorted him by bypaths through the dangerous part of the
country, and put him on to the main road to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">These police, thirty in number, have all remained loyal to
the Government. One of them was murdered by the rebels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
but the remainder all reported themselves to the Chief Native
Commissioner, by whom they were disarmed, but they have
since been employed on Government service.</p>

<p class="i1">Mr. Reed was saved by the Makalaka amongst whom he
was working. They informed him that the Greek trader
living near him had been murdered, and told him plainly
that he too would be killed unless he got away to a place of
safety. At the same time a horse was sent to him by the
Rev. Mr. Carnegie from Hope Fountain, together with a letter
containing information concerning the generally disturbed state
of the country. This decided him to leave his station for the
time being and retire on Bulawayo, which place he reached
safely the day before the return of my patrol from Mangwe.</p>

<p class="i1">During my absence two patrols, somewhat stronger than
those first sent out, had been despatched to the Gwanda and
Shiloh districts. The first, under Captains Brand and Van
Niekerk, had left town on the previous Thursday, in order to
relieve a party of prospectors and families said to be in laager
in the Gwanda district. This patrol consisted of one hundred
mounted men—fifty of C troop and fifty of the Africander
Corps—and was accompanied by a mule waggon and a Maxim
gun. The second patrol, numbering one hundred and sixty-nine
men all told, and accompanied by a Maxim gun, was
commanded by the Hon. Maurice Gifford, and had started on
the Friday night to dislodge an impi, which it was reported
had gathered in the hills near Shiloh. I will first give a
short account of the proceedings of the Gwanda patrol, for
the most interesting portion of which, namely the account of
the return journey to Bulawayo, I am indebted to Lieutenant
Webb of the Africander Corps, who has most kindly placed
the graphic description which he has himself written of this
fateful march at my disposal.</p>

<p class="i1">Leaving Bulawayo at six o'clock on Thursday evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
2nd April, the first halt was made at Spargot's store, some
six miles from town. Here the horses were off-saddled for
an hour. During the halt one of the sentries found a wounded
Kafir lying in the grass, who, on examination, proved to be
the colonial boy "Jim," who had been so terribly knocked
about by the Matabele at Edkins' store, that when discovered
there it was not thought he could possibly survive many
hours; and yet, thanks to the food that had been left with
him, he had not only been able to keep body and soul
together, but had recovered in the course of a few days
sufficiently to enable him to make his way slowly and by easy
stages, travelling always by night, to Bulawayo. Fortunately
he was never short of food, as the rainy season being not yet
over, the young maize cobs—green mealies—were standing
ready for plucking in all the native fields.</p>

<p class="i1">After leaving Spargot's the next halting-place was Dawson's
store at the Umzingwani river, which was reached late at
night. The store it was found had been burnt and destroyed
by the Kafirs, but the mule stables were still standing, and
in them a plentiful supply of maize was obtained for the
horses. The latter were all placed inside the stable fence,
whilst the men lay down behind their saddles on the rising
ground outside. The pickets were fired on during the night,
but a few volleys from a portion of the Africander Corps drove
the Kafirs off, though they were afterwards heard calling to
one another in the hills near the river.</p>

<p class="i1">"When day broke no natives were to be seen, and the
horses were at once saddled up, and the march continued.
Spiro's store, thirty-seven miles from Bulawayo, was found
to have been totally destroyed by fire, but Grainger's hotel,
twelve miles farther on, was still standing. The Kafirs had,
however, apparently only just left it before the patrol arrived,
as everything was in the utmost disorder, and water was discovered 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in a bucket which had evidently only just been
brought up from the stream, as some of it had been spilt on
the ground. A large supply of maize was again found in the
mule stables, so the horses got another good feed.</p>

<p class="i1">In the evening the expedition moved on to Grainger's
second store, which it was found had not been interfered with
by the natives. Here Friday night was passed, the men
again lying down behind their saddles. Early the following
morning Dawson's store at "Amanzi minyama" was reached.
It was found to have been very recently deserted by its
European occupants, and since their departure had been
partially looted by Kafirs. From here a move was made to
Mr. Nicholson's camp, some four miles farther down the road,
where it was thought that all the white men in the Gwanda
district had probably collected. On arriving there a most
excellent fort was discovered on the top of a kopje near the
camp. Whilst the fort was being strengthened, Mr. Zeederberg,
the well-known post contractor, and three more men
rode down the Tuli road to discover how far ahead the
Gwanda people were. Mr. Zeederberg and one of these
men rode through to Tuli, in order to despatch telegrams to
Bulawayo; but the other two returned the following day,
after having caught up the waggon with the people from
Dawson's store, who were retiring on Tuli, and who reported
that the Gwanda party was thirteen hours ahead of them,
making for the same destination. On Sunday, 5th April, two
more despatch-riders were sent to Tuli with farther messages
for Bulawayo, asking that reinforcements and a Hotchkiss
gun should be sent down to meet the patrol on its return, as,
from information received from a native scout, it was believed
that the Kafirs would attack them in force at some point
along the road. On Wednesday morning the despatch-riders
returned, with a message informing Captain Brand that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
was impossible to send the reinforcements asked for, and requesting
him to return as soon as possible to Bulawayo. On
Monday, the day after the despatch-riders had left, an escort
which had been sent in charge of a waggon to Dawson's store
to bring in some supplies was fired on by the Kafirs. Captain
Van Niekerk with some men of the Africander Corps, and
some of C troop under Mr. Holland, immediately went off
in pursuit, but beyond a few stragglers saw nothing of them.
On the following day Captain Van Niekerk and Mr. Purssell
went out with a force to patrol round the store and bring in
all the remaining stores left. They found the country strewn
for several miles with blankets, boots, etc., left by the Kafirs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in their hasty flight on the preceding day, but again no
resistance was met with.</p>

    CAPTAIN VAN NIEKERK<br />
    who commanded the Africander Corps of the Bulawayo
    Field Force in many engagements during the last campaign.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">From this point I will proceed with the narrative in
Lieutenant Webb's own words, as follows:—"We started
early the next morning, 9th April, on our return journey.
By lunch time we had marched fifteen miles, and reached
Grainger's store No. 2. This place we found had been burnt to
the ground by the Matabele during our stay at Gwanda, and
judging by the spoor a large number of them had been at work.
We decided to stay the rest of the day at this place, and
were careful to take every necessary precaution in case of a
night attack. Next morning we saddled up at daybreak,
and covered twelve miles to Grainger's store No. 1, before
halting. This store had in our absence shared the same fate
as the other, and we recovered nothing from the ashes. As
we were now entering a most dangerous section of the road,
we were careful to use extra vigilance. At about ten o'clock
we came up with some cattle at the foot of the range of hills
on our left, but before capturing them, narrowly inspected
the hills for natives, as we suspected a trap. Sure enough on
a ridge about 1000 yards away we made out a body of men
hiding under cover. We at once put the Maxim on them,
and as they retreated in haste up the side of the hill, we
found that several hundreds of them had been waiting in
ambush. They only returned our fire with one or two shots.
We were then going through thick bush, with hills a couple
of hundred yards away towering on each side.</p>

<p class="i1">"Upon emerging from these, we came to the ruins of
Spiro's store, and about a mile beyond we saw a column of
smoke ascending, and rightly conjectured that this was the
place where they meant to attack us. The situation was all
in their favour. We had to pass through a narrow neck
amongst the hills in order to emerge into comparatively open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
country, though even this latter afforded them ample cover
from our fire. The first evidence we had of the ambuscade
was a steady and prolonged fire directed at the head of the
column (composed of our corps) from the kopjes on the left
flank. We at once returned the fire; but so well was the
enemy concealed amongst the rocks, that I may tell you—though
you will hardly credit my statement—that I scarcely
saw one of them for half an hour. As the column was pressing
on to get out of the dangerous position we were in, a few of
Captain Brand's men fired just in front of the faces of the
mules drawing the provision waggon. The mules swerved
round suddenly, and broke the disselboom. Whilst the
damage was being repaired, Mr. Jobson, who was in command
of the Maxim, brought his gun into action with the greatest
coolness and promptitude; but this unfortunate accident
delayed us for half an hour, and was largely responsible for
the wounds of many horses and men.</p>

<p class="i1">"When we at last emerged from the pass, the disorganised
appearance of the column showed the severity of the enemy's
fire, and I firmly believe it was due to the fact that there
were a number of old campaigners in the Africander Corps,
which was commanded by our cool and experienced chief
Captain Van Niekerk, that we escaped annihilation. When
we had got the men into skirmishing order, we were better
able to cope with the enemy; and when I tell you that the
latter were over 1000 strong and followed us for over five
miles at a distance of little more than 200 yards, you will be
better able to judge of the task we had in hand. Our route
lay over successive ranges of ridges and valleys, and afforded
plenty of cover for the enemy, as the grass was about three feet
high, and the country thickly studded with bush and trees.
They formed a half-moon round us and skirmished excellently,
taking advantage of every bit of cover. They also fought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
with ferocious determination, and often showed pluck verging
on lunacy. They were kept well in hand by their leaders,
who constantly urged them to fire low. Our horses and men
were now falling with deadly monotony, and we all saw the
importance of getting into more open country. Our men
were firing steadily and rapidly all this time, and the Maxim
did good service; but being on the move and owing to the
tactics of the enemy, did not do the execution we were
accustomed to see in the first Matabele war.</p>

<p class="i1">"At last, after about three hours' fighting, we saw about a
mile ahead of us a round stone kopje, for which we made in
order to take a short halt. The enemy at once saw through
our movement, and a number of them endeavoured to defeat
our object by out-flanking our advance. Our horsemen, however,
were too sharp for them, and by hard riding reached
the kopje first, and held them in check until the main body
arrived. The kopje we thus reached was nothing but a huge
flat rock, showing out about twelve or fifteen feet above the
surrounding country. It was almost surrounded by broken
rocks and trees, and under this cover—in some instances only
some thirty to forty yards from where we were standing—the
Matabele concealed themselves, and continued their fire upon
us. This alone will give you some idea of their astounding
audacity and bravery. We had to charge them four times to
make them at last give in and retire. It was now about sundown
(5.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>), and we had actually been about six hours
fighting over five miles of country.</p>

<p class="i1">"When at last we had time to look about us, we saw a
scene that I for one shall never forget. The men still stood at
their posts about the kopje keeping a good look-out. Across
the plain through which we had come could be seen the
carcasses of horses slain, and the bodies of men lying as
they fell. On the kopje itself was the little ammunition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
waggonette, capable of holding two men comfortably, and
now surrounded by the wounded and dying. We found that
we had lost five men shot dead, and two more were dying,
whilst over twenty others were wounded, and thirty-three
horses had been killed. Of the enemy we estimated that we
had killed and wounded between two and three hundred. I
do not think that any one of us had reckoned upon having
such a tough job in getting through the pass, and even now
our position was very grave. Prompt action was needed to
get us out of our difficulty, and after consultation amongst
the officers, we decided at once to move on, so as to give the
Matabele no time for united action to surround us during the
night. Our greatest difficulty was the conveyance of our
wounded, and how any of the poor fellows survived that
night will always remain a mystery. In the little waggonette
we had to place eight, and on the Maxim gun-carriage we
carried several more. The remainder were fortunately able
to ride.</p>

<p class="i1">"We left the kopje at dusk, and for the next sixteen
miles had a most unpleasant section of the road to traverse,
on any portion of which the Matabele had us at their mercy
had they chosen to attack. Whether they had had enough
fighting, or whether they did not suspect our departure, is not
known, but we were all heartily glad to get through that
section of the country unmolested. At half-past four on the
morning of the 11th of April, we met the relief force sent to
meet us, and two hours later we halted in front of the
Government Offices in Bulawayo. That afternoon we buried
one of my most intimate friends, poor Baker, who had been
shot in the fight, and died on the homeward march."</p>

<p class="i1">From the foregoing narrative it is evident that this small
patrol of 100 men narrowly escaped annihilation at the hands
of the Matabele; and I should be doing an injustice if I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
not state that, in the opinion of at any rate the majority of
those who took part in the fight, they were only saved from
destruction by the determined bravery combined with cool
judgment—the result of long experience gained in many a
previous fight with Kafirs in the Old Colony and the Transvaal—shown
by Captain Van Niekerk, who took over the
command during the action. Captain Brand, who was the
senior officer, and who is as gallant a fellow as ever stepped,
indeed brave to the point of foolhardiness, but who had had no
previous experience of native warfare, showed both generosity
of character and soundness of judgment in asking Van
Niekerk to take over the command directly he saw that his
men were in a tight place. Van Niekerk himself speaks
enthusiastically of the cool bravery shown throughout this
trying time by all the men forming the patrol. They were
all equally brave, he says. But amongst the Africanders
there were many old Kafir fighters, such as old Mr.
Steyn and Messrs. Loots and Ferreira, and these old campaigners
were naturally more useful than inexperienced men.
Lieutenants Webb and Holland, Purssell and Jobson—the
latter in charge of the Maxim gun—did their duty throughout
the engagement as coolly as if they were on parade. Five
dead men had to be left on the field, viz. Messrs. Forbes,
Pack, Greer, Hayland, and Green. Mr. Baker died on the
Maxim carriage, and his body was laid on the roadside eight
miles from Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning, Saturday, 11th April, a party
was sent out to bring in the body, which they did, but they
were fired on from a kopje near the road. No damage however
was done, and poor Baker was buried the same afternoon.</p>

<p class="i1">About half-past eight on the previous evening, a messenger—Mr.
White, attached to the Africander Corps—had reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
town, with a despatch from Captain Brand, saying that he
was in a tight place and feared that his ammunition might
run short if the fight lasted much longer. Mr. White had
left the patrol about four o'clock in the afternoon, and some
two hours earlier had been struck on the head by a bullet,
which luckily however only inflicted a scalp wound, stunning
him for the moment.</p>

<p class="i1">On his arrival there was great excitement in Bulawayo,
and a relief force was at once organised to go to Captain
Brand's assistance. Being then in town, I and my men of
course volunteered like every one else, and I well remember
how bitterly disappointed we were that we could not go. As
it happened, the relief force was not required to rescue the
patrol, which had extricated itself from a very difficult
position without assistance; but its appearance must have
been most welcome to the jaded men, whose horses when
they reached Bulawayo had been upwards of twenty-six
hours under the saddle without food or rest. Thus ended
one of the toughest fights of the present campaign, in which
more than one-third of the men engaged were either killed
or wounded, and more than one-third of the horses were likewise
killed. Several men, whose wounds were slight, never
reported themselves at all. Brave Captain Van Niekerk was
twice hit, one bullet cutting his bandoleer-strap and bruising
his shoulder, and the second smashing the stock of his
revolver and bruising his side. The Kafirs, although they
probably lost heavily, had the satisfaction of getting possession
of the dead bodies of five white men to mutilate, together
with the saddles and other accoutrements of the horses killed;
whilst, worst of all from our point of view, several Lee-Metford
rifles and bandoleers full of cartridges fell into their hands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">For</span> the following narrative of what is now known as
Gifford's fight in the Shiloh Hills, I am indebted to an
officer in Gifford's Horse, who has done very good service
throughout the campaign, but who however has modestly
asked me not to mention his name.</p>

<p class="i1">"The patrol under Lieutenant-Colonel Gifford—now
commonly known as the Shiloh Patrol—consisted of Gifford's
Horse, with thirty-one men of F troop under Captain Dawson,
and eleven men of Grey's Scouts under Lieutenant F. Crewe—one
hundred and eighteen Europeans in all, with one
Maxim gun and forty-nine Colonial Boys under Captain
Bisset. Captain J. W. Lumsden accompanied the patrol as
chief of the Staff and second in command.</p>

<p class="i1">"We left Bulawayo about one o'clock on Saturday morning,
4th April. It was bright moonlight, and we travelled on
without any delay or anything exciting happening till the
sun rose, when we outspanned at M'Kisa's kraal, about twelve
miles from Bulawayo. I believe we had a sort of roving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
commission to go down to the Khami river, break up an
impi or two there, then to go over to Inyati, do the same
there, and finally to come out on the Salisbury road at the
Bembisi.</p>

<p class="i1">"At our first outspan however Colonel Gifford obtained
information that there was an impi encamped down the
Umguza, on Holm's farm, about fourteen miles to the north
of us, and he determined to have a go at them. We therefore
broke camp about two o'clock and trekked on through
very bad country, heavy sand and thick bush.</p>

<p class="i1">"We had just got into better and more open country when
continuous firing was heard on our right, in which direction
a few of our scouts were out, and shortly afterwards a party
of two or three hundred Matabele were seen coming down
from a ridge on our right, and the rear-guard—B troop,
under Captain Fynn—were soon engaged with them. At
this juncture Colonel Gifford sent back Captain Dawson's
troop and the Colonial Boys to support Captain Fynn, and
after about an hour's heavy firing the Matabele withdrew
into the hills close by.</p>

<p class="i1">"In the meantime, the rest of the column had drawn out
into an open space and laagered up. The scouts turned up
just before the Matabele attacked, having narrowly escaped
being cut off. We passed a quiet night as the enemy made
no move, though we could see them in the hills, and they
fired occasional shots at the laager before it got dark. Next
morning we started again after breakfast, but had not gone
more than a couple of miles, when the wily Matabele showed
himself again, and in stronger force. Our advance guard,
A troop, under Captain Meikle, were attacked, and at the
same time a party of two or three hundred came down on our
right and attacked the column. They did not come on very
close—to do this they would have had to cross the Umguza
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
river, and this they did not seem to care about doing, but
kept on the other side of the river firing at the column and
showing themselves in pretty strong force. Colonel Gifford
then opened on them with the Maxim at about 600 yards,
and this quite quenched their military ardour. It was funny
to see the way in which they all immediately lay down in
the grass and then spread out, and finally strutted off into
the bush, bending down and hiding themselves as much as
they could in the grass all the time.</p>

<p class="i1">"During this time A troop had beaten off the attack on
the advance, and Captain Bisset's boys who were on the left
advance fell on the already defeated party and did some
damage, killing twenty or thirty of them. As the enemy
appeared to be all round us, we outspanned again, and, the
men remaining at their posts, a biscuit each was served out
all round, and the horses were allowed to graze. No further
attack was made, and we trekked on again to Fonseca's farm
without any further hindrance from our enemy, though we
could see an impi on our right keeping along with us all the
way, though at a safe distance.</p>

<p class="i1">"We camped and laagered behind our saddles in an open
glade. Behind us was a ridge of kopjes, on one of which was
the homestead, on our left was thick bush, and on our right
was a dry river-bed. Just beyond, and parallel to it, ran a
stream in which were some deep pools of water. These riverbeds
afterwards proved to be our salvation, or at any rate of
great assistance in our defence.</p>

<p class="i1">"We passed another quiet night, and next morning, Easter
Monday, at daybreak, the men made the fires and were soon
brewing their coffee, as it was bitterly cold. The usual patrol
of five or six men was sent out to scout round, and the
Colonial Boys were sent out to look for cattle, as we had so
far only had "bully" to eat, and a change was desirable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
They had not been out long when Lieutenant Rorke, who was
in command of the morning patrol, came across the impi
holding an "indaba" in a kraal. He and his patrol opened
fire on them, to which they promptly replied by rushing our men.
Lieutenant Rorke had a very narrow escape; his horse broke away
from him, and he was compelled to retire as best he could on
foot. The Colonial Boys, who were not far behind, and his own
few men, however, checked the enemy, and saved his life.</p>

<p class="i1">"This opened the ball; as soon as the firing was heard in
camp, Colonel Gifford ordered Dawson's troop out in support,
and B troop under Captain Fynn were ordered up into the
kopjes where Fonseca's homestead stood. The battle soon
became general, and there was heavy firing through the bush
on our left, which was occupied by the Colonial Boys, Captains
Dawson's and Fynn's troops. Colonel Gifford then gave the
order for the men in laager to take cover in the bed of the
stream to which I have already referred. The two small
waggons, one of which carried ammunition, and the other our
provisions, and on which the Maxim was standing on its
tripod, were quickly drawn up alongside of the gully, and the
men took up their positions and manned the banks of both
streams, which formed a natural laager. Colonel Gifford then
sent out the gallopers to call the troops in to laager, not a
minute too soon. Captain Fynn's troop, with whom was
Captain Lumsden, were fairly rushed by the enemy, who
poured a fire into them at close range. Here Trooper Kenneth
M'Kenzie was shot through the head and dropped dead from
his horse. Trooper Fielding was wounded in the leg, and his
horse shot under him, and Captain Lumsden's horse also fell
shot under him. Captain Fynn, however, brought his men
into laager in good order, returning the enemy's fire. Captain
Dawson and the Colonial Boys also retired in good order into
laager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">"The Matabele came on close behind, and our men were
hardly in laager when they rushed out into the open from the
bush, with the evident intention of charging the laager. The
steady fire from the men, however, soon checked them, and a
few shots from the Maxim made them retire into the bush
again. A few of their bravest, having taken cover behind
some stumps and dead trees which were lying in the open,
kept up a galling fire on the laager, but these were soon
picked off by some of our good shots.</p>

<p class="i1">"One man, however, came on in the open and appeared to
bear a charmed life, as no bullets touched him; he had no
gun or assegai, but came on alone down the valley towards
us. He must have got to within about 150 yards of the
laager when he fell shot in the leg. He rose again, and only
then turned to fly, but the charm seemed to be broken, and
he fell dead, shot through with several bullets.</p>

<p class="i1">"In the afternoon, when we were able to go out to where
he lay, we found he had in his hands a skin-bag full of fat,
and some of the usual witch-doctor's throwing bones—no
arms of any sort. Apparently he was a witch-doctor, or one
of the priests of the much-talked-of 'Umlimo,' who thought
he'd do for the white man by means of his bones and incantations
and that the white man's bullets were to turn to
water before him as had been predicted. The Matabele
lined the bush all down our front and took to the kopjes,
from where, at about 600 yards, they kept up a continuous
fire.</p>

<p class="i1">"Colonel Gifford had all the time been standing on the
waggon alongside of the Maxim directing the fire, and giving
his orders to the men. The enemy on our front were not
more than 200 yards away, and were making good shooting,
aiming especially at the waggon and Maxim. Here poor
Reynolds was mortally wounded, having been shot through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the arm and lungs, and dying within a brief space. Soon
afterwards Colonel Gifford was wounded in the shoulder.
The men saw he had been hit; but he called out, "It's all
right, boys, don't mind me—give it to them—give it to them."
He had soon, however, to be lifted down from the waggon
and carried into the bed of the stream, at the same time
calling on Captain Lumsden to take command. Troopers
J. Walker (Gifford's Horse) and Eatwell (Dawson's) were
wounded shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class="i1">"The fire from the enemy slackened soon after this, but
they kept up a desultory fire till about twelve o'clock, when
they finally drew off and left us in peace, though we could
see them every now and then in the bush.</p>

<p class="i1">"Shortly after Colonel Gifford was wounded Captain
Lumsden, after consulting the officers, sent in to Bulawayo a
despatch by two of Captain Bisset's boys on horseback,
reporting that Colonel Gifford was wounded, and asking for
assistance, as both ammunition and food were running short.</p>

<p class="i1">"As soon as the natives drew off the horses were let out
to graze, and we spent the afternoon, as far as we could,
strengthening our position. As the sun went down we could
see smoke from what we judged to be the enemy's camp behind
the kopjes, and on the top of one of these, against the
sky, we saw what was evidently their sentry carefully
watching us. We passed a quiet night, and next day had a
repetition of our Monday's experience.</p>

<p class="i1">"After an early breakfast of one biscuit per man all round,
some of the Colonial Boys were sent up on to the kopjes to
see where our enemy had got to. This was soon very evident,
as the Matabele came up from beyond the kopjes and chased
our boys down and back into camp. They came out into
the open again exactly as on the previous day, but this time
from the kopje side. The fire from our men soon checked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
them and drove them back into the bush, and they then
spread right round us and opened fire from every side. Captain
Lumsden was wounded in the leg while walking about the
laager, giving orders and directing the Maxim, and immediately
carried down into the donga, which was our place of
safety. Captain Bisset then took command. Lieutenant Hulbert
was soon afterwards wounded in the leg by a Lee-Metford
bullet. After keeping up a desultory fire till about mid-day,
the enemy again retired, as we afterwards found out having
had quite enough of the white men in the dongas. In the
afternoon some of B troop and the Colonial Boys went out
and recovered poor M'Kenzie's body, which was lying where
he fell. Both he and Corporal Reynolds were buried by
their comrades in the centre of our laager, between the two
dongas.</p>

<p class="i1">"At about two o'clock a despatch-rider arrived from
Captain Macfarlane, who, with the relief column, was about
five miles off.</p>

<p class="i1">"Captain Macfarlane's column arrived soon afterwards,
and we were very glad to see them, as provisions were running
short. We had about a biscuit per man and seven tins of
bully beef left, and not too much ammunition for another
fight. Our troubles were then over, except for our poor
wounded.</p>

<p class="i1">"We broke laager next morning, and carried them off on
the waggons as carefully as we could into town, arriving in
Bulawayo that night (Wednesday), late. It was, however, a
long weary journey for them, twenty-two miles over the stumps
and stones of a South African road. Captain Lumsden died
next day in hospital, to the universal regret of all who had
met him and served under him. Our own brave Colonel had
to lose his arm, so our leaders suffered severely. Certainly
they by their coolness and daring behaviour inspired confidence 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in their men, and helped to keep the fire steady.
That the firing of our men was exceptionally steady there is
no doubt. After the first rush it was impossible for a Matabele
to show himself without receiving three or four bullets
most uncomfortably near him, if he did not receive his
quietus. It was estimated that the patrol killed at lowest
200 of the enemy, and many more must have been wounded.
The Maxim did not have much chance, as after the first rush
the Matabele spread themselves out in the bush, and kept
under very good cover, and it then became a matter of sharpshooting.
On the Monday, and the last day's fight, the enemy
must have been about 1500 strong. As we could see, they
increased every day, and we afterwards heard from native
reports that reinforcements were joining them all the time.
We also heard that after the failure of the last attack the
impi retired and sent round the country for still further
reinforcements. When they arrived and the impis came
back to the scene of their flight, they found the dongas
empty—the white men had gone."</p>

<p class="chapsum">Despatch from Captain Laing—Laager formed at Belingwe—Strange conduct
of a native policeman—Three Matabele caught looting and hanged—"Young
Tradesman's" letter to the <i>Daily Graphic</i>—Matabele capture a
herd of cattle and murder some Zambesi Kafirs near Bulawayo—Determination
to build forts between Bulawayo and Mangwe—I am sent to
establish forts and take command of all troops on the road—Fort Molyneux—I
return to Bulawayo to report my views—Curious position of
affairs in Matabeleland.</p>


<p><span class="sc">On</span> the day before the return of Brand's patrol, the first
news was received from Belingwe that had reached Bulawayo
since the outbreak of the insurrection. The despatch
was from Captain Laing, who was in command there, and
was to the effect that all the whites in the district were in
laager, and that they felt confident of being able to resist any
attack made upon them by the natives.</p>

<p class="i1">This news gave great relief to many people who had
friends in the Belingwe district, for it was not known
whether they had been able to collect together and form a
laager, or whether they had been surprised and murdered
before they were aware that anything was amiss; as indeed
they would have been, in all probability, had not Mr. H. P.
Fynn, the native commissioner in the Insiza district, sent a
message to Captain Laing to warn him that a native rising
seemed imminent immediately after he was informed of the
murder of Mr. Maddocks. This message was faithfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
carried by one of Mr. Fynn's native policemen, and Captain
Laing, recognising the gravity of the situation, at once acted
with the promptitude and decision which always distinguish
him, and ordered all the whites in his district to
immediately come in to laager at Belingwe.</p>

<p class="i1">They were only just in time, for the natives showed
their teeth very soon afterwards, and although fearing to
attack the laager, succeeded in driving off a considerable
number of cattle. Captain Laing, accompanied by only nine
men—all he was able to mount—then in his turn attacked
the insurgents, and succeeded in recapturing some of the
cattle, though these were of little value, as the rinderpest
was amongst them. It is worthy of remark that the native
policeman who took the message to Captain Laing, which
probably saved many white men's lives in the Belingwe
district, never returned to his duty, but as is now known,
went over to the rebels with his rifle and bandoleer full of
cartridges. This fact, taken in conjunction with many other
circumstances, goes to prove that the secret of the actual
date of the outbreak of the insurrection was not known to
the mass of the people, though probably, owing to the prophetic
utterances ascribed to the Umlimo, which had been
diligently circulated amongst them, they were in a state of
expectancy; but this policeman, for instance, must have
been thoroughly taken by surprise, and after the first
murders remained loyal to the Government until he was got
at by some one capable of explaining to him the scope of the
whole plot.</p>

<p class="i1">On 10th April, too, a further excitement was caused in
Bulawayo by the arrest of three Matabele rebels. They
were captured near Soluso's, some twenty miles west of Bulawayo,
by Marzwe's Friendlies, and sent in to town by Josana,
having been caught red-handed, looting and burning property
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
belonging to white men. I was present when the evidence
was taken, and it certainly seemed to me to be overwhelming,
especially as one of them was known to Mr. Colenbrander,
and they all three acknowledged themselves to be
the subjects of a certain Induna named Maiyaisa, who with
all his people has been amongst the rebels from the first outbreak
of the insurrection. They were caught, too, with
assegais in their hands, looting a white man's farm, so that it
might very reasonably be asked "que diable allaient-ils faire
dans cette galère?"</p>

<p class="i1">At any rate they were condemned to death, and hanged
forthwith, all three on one tree on the outskirts of Bulawayo.
Besides these three men who had been incontestably guilty
of taking part in the rebellion, and who were hanged together,
six others were hanged singly and at different times, all of
whom, if they were tried in a somewhat rough-and-ready
fashion, were undoubtedly spies and rebels.</p>

<p class="i1">These are the only Matabele who have been hanged during
the present insurrection, and a letter therefore on the subject
of hanging natives which appeared in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> of
Saturday, 13th June, purporting to have been written by a
young tradesman of Bulawayo, is a trifle incorrect, to say the
least of it. A portion of the letter runs as follows: "My
stand has one big tree on it, and it is often used as a gallows.
Yesterday there was a goodly crop of seven Matabele hanging
there; to-day there are eight, the eighth being a nigger who
was heard boasting to a companion that he had helped to kill
white men, and got back to town without being suspected."</p>

<p class="i1">This letter was reproduced by Mr. Labouchere in <i>Truth</i>,
as well as another he got hold of at the same time, in which
the writer expresses it as his opinion that "it is grand fun
potting niggers off, and seeing them fall like nine-pins," while
further on he speaks of it being "quite a nice sight" to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
men shot as spies. I can quite believe that a man who can
write in this strain would take pleasure in, or "would not
object," as he puts it, to seeing Kafirs shot, but I doubt very
much if such an one would ever risk his skin to enjoy "the
grand fun" he speaks of.</p>

<p class="i1">It seems a pity that a writer who takes "Truth" as the
motto of his paper, should seize upon every little scrap of
published matter he can discover (apparently without inquiry
as to its real value), and not only reproduce it as gospel in
an ensuing number of his journal, but found a sermon upon
it into the bargain on the iniquities of his fellow-countrymen
in Rhodesia. However, we have the consolation of knowing
that nothing has discredited the editor of <i>Truth</i> in the eyes
of all fair-minded men so much as the hostile feeling he has
ever shown against the British settlers in Rhodesia, whilst,
happily for that colony, his rage is as impotent as that of "a
viper gnawing at an old file."</p>

<p class="i1">During the week in which the aforesaid Kafirs were
hanged, some parties of Matabele approached the town very
closely at nights, and on the night of 6th April one of them
succeeded in capturing a herd of cattle within a mile and a
half of the hospital, at the same time murdering some
Zambesi Kafirs who were sleeping outside the cattle kraal.
As at this time there was a herd of cattle which was
penned every night in a kraal near Dr. Sauer's house,
some two miles away on the other side of the town, I was
asked to take some of my men and lie in wait for any
Matabele who might attempt to capture them on the following
night.</p>

<p class="i1">I went down and reconnoitred the position during the
day, and after dark rode down with fifteen good men. We
first off-saddled our horses, and tied them up within the
paling round Dr. Sauer's house, and then took up our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
positions along two walls of the square stone cattle kraal.
During the night, the weather, which had been fine and
warm, suddenly changed; a cold wind sprang up, and masses
of cloud spread over the sky from the south-east. It looked
as if it was going to rain every minute, but luckily the wind
kept it off. However, it was bitterly cold, and we were all
of us very glad when day at last dawned and our weary vigil
was over, for no Kafirs came near us; and when I examined
the cattle I did not think it likely they would, as the rinderpest
was rife amongst them, two lying dead in the kraal,
whilst many others, the herd boy told us, lay rotting about
the veld all round.</p>

<p class="i1">About this time the authorities determined to carry out a
scheme for keeping open communications with the south by
means of forts which were to be built along the road between
Bulawayo and Mangwe. As a commencement in this direction,
Captain Molyneux left Bulawayo, on Saturday, 11th
April, with sixty men to establish a fort at Fig Tree,
distant thirty miles down the road, whilst at the same time
Captain Luck was ordered up from Mangwe with fifty men
to build a second fort some fifteen miles from that place, in
the centre of the hilly country through which the coach road
passes.</p>

<p class="i1">Two days later I was sent down the road to establish
further forts between Fig Tree and Mangwe, and to take
command of all garrisons on the road, the force with which I
left town consisting of sixty men of H troop of the Bulawayo
Field Force (my own), forty men of E troop under
Captain Halsted, and twenty of the Africander Corps under
Lieutenant Webb.</p>

<p class="i1">We left Bulawayo on the evening of Monday, 13th April,
and slept that night at Wilson's farm, reaching Mabukitwani
the following evening. From information I received there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
concerning the movements of the Matabele, I became convinced
that the dangerous part of the road was that portion
of it lying between Bulawayo and Fig Tree, and not the hill
passes farther on, as the inhabitants of the latter are all
Makalakas, the rebel Matabele who had been living amongst
them having all come up nearer to Bulawayo, and joined
their compatriots on the Khami river.</p>

<p class="i1">According to the plan which I had been asked to carry
out, the thirty miles of road between Bulawayo and Fig Tree
would have been left entirely undefended, which did not
appear to me to be at all advisable in view of the fact that
there was a large impi under the Induna Maiyaisa encamped
on the Khami, only twelve miles below the ford on the main
coach road. I therefore took it upon myself to send Lieutenant
Webb with his twenty men back to the Khami river, to
commence a fort there, at the same time despatching a
messenger to Bulawayo requesting Colonel Napier to reinforce
him with another twenty or thirty men. At the same time I
gave it as my opinion that a fort ought also to be established
at Mabukitwani.</p>

<p class="i1">On Wednesday afternoon we reached Fig Tree, where we
found that Captain Molyneux had already nearly completed
an almost impregnable fort, which had been built on a small
isolated kopje, itself a natural stronghold, about 200 yards
from the mule stables, hotel, and telegraph office at Fig
Tree. The natural strength of this kopje had been most
cunningly taken advantage of and increased by blasting a
rock out here and there, and fortifying the weak places with
sand-bags. Good water was obtainable in the bed of a stream
at the very foot of the kopje, whilst a recess amongst the rocks
near its base had been cleared in such a way as to form a
stable within which some twenty horses could be completely
sheltered from the bullets of any attacking force. Altogether,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Fort Molyneux was a perfect little place of its kind, and
did every credit to the very capable officer by whom it was
built.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following day we went on to Shashani neck, some five
and a half miles beyond Fort Molyneux. Here the road descends
for a distance of three miles into the Shashani valley, winding
continually in and out amongst thickly-wooded granite hills.
Had the Kafirs, at the commencement of the insurrection, put
a force of 1000 men armed with rifles, backed by another
1000 with assegais, into this pass, it is my opinion that they
would have completely cut off all communication between
Bulawayo and the south until a body of troops at least
1000 strong had been sent up from Mafeking to open the
road. However, luckily they missed this opportunity, as
they have missed every other chance they have had of striking
a really effective blow at the white men. In fact, they have
shown a general want of intelligence that stamps them as an
altogether inferior people, in brain capacity at least, to the
European.</p>

<p class="i1">About one-third of the way down the pass Captain Halsted
and I found a kopje close to water, which commanded
the road, and at the same time could be rendered absolutely
impregnable to such enemies as the Matabele with a comparatively
small amount of labour. Here I left Captain
Halsted with the men of E troop to build a fort, and on
Friday morning, 17th April, went on with my own troop to
the Matoli river where Captain Luck had already almost
completed a strong fort of earthworks and palisades in the
centre of a large open space amongst the hills, by none of
which, however, was it commanded. Here I met Major
Armstrong from Mangwe, and as all I heard from him
regarding the state of affairs in his district only confirmed
me in the opinion that it would be a waste of time and men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to build another fort between Matoli and Mangwe, as I had
been instructed to do, whilst on the other hand I felt that it
was of vital importance to establish forts without delay
between Fig Tree and Bulawayo, I determined to return to
town and lay my views before the administrator personally
before proceeding farther southwards.</p>

<p class="i1">Major Armstrong having also official business to transact
in Bulawayo, we arranged to ride in together forthwith.
On passing Captain Halsted late in the afternoon we found
that he had already made wonderful progress with the stronghold
which is now known to fame as Fort Halsted. Just at
dusk we reached Fort Molyneux, where we got an excellent
dinner and were made comfortable for the night. Here I
received a telegram from Colonel Napier, telling me that at
the present moment he could not possibly spare any men
from Bulawayo to reinforce Lieutenant Webb at the Khami
river, as the Kafirs were massing round the town; and that
as twenty men was too small a number to leave alone without
reinforcements, he had ordered him to fall back on Fig Tree,
or join Captain Halsted for the present.</p>

<p class="i1">At daylight Lieutenant Webb turned up, and as Captain
Molyneux had over fifty men at Fig Tree, and Captain
Halsted only forty, I sent him on to the latter. Major
Armstrong and I then saddled up, and reached Bulawayo
about two o'clock on Saturday, 18th April, having passed the
down coach accompanied by a strong escort at the Khami
river. The situation in Matabeleland was now a sufficiently
curious one. In Bulawayo were some 1500 white men,
women, and children, all of whom, although they were able
to visit their houses in different parts of the town by day,
had to seek safety within the laager at nights, and were not
allowed to leave it before seven o'clock in the morning. At
this time the whole of Matabeleland, with the exception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Bulawayo, and the laagers of Gwelo and Belingwe, was
absolutely in the hands of the Kafirs, although, apparently by
the orders of the Umlimo, the main road to the south had
not been closed. A large impi lay at Mr. Crewe's farm,
Redbank, on the Khami river, about twelve miles to the
west of the town, besides which some thousands of rebels,
amongst whom it was said was Lo Bengula's eldest son,
Inyamanda, were camped all along the Umguza, considerable
numbers of them being actually within three miles of Bulawayo,
whilst other two large impis had taken up their
quarters amongst the Elibaini Hills, and in the neighbourhood
of Intaba Induna, there being altogether not less than
10,000 hostile natives spread out in a semicircle from the
west to the north-east of the town. Had these different
impis only combined and acted in concert under one leader
they might have accomplished something; but each impi
appears to have been acting independently of the others, and
my own belief is that they kept hanging round the town
without any general plan of action, in the expectation of
some supernatural interference by the deity on their behalf.
At least this is what we hear from themselves, and I think it
is the truth. Besides the impis to the north and west, there
were others encamped within the edge of the Matopo Hills.
These latter, however, although they blocked the Tuli road
and destroyed the mission station at Hope Fountain, which
had been established for over twenty-five years, never
approached Bulawayo.</p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> was, I think, on Thursday, 16th April, that it was first
realised that the Matabele had really advanced to within a
short distance of the town. On that day, information having
been received that there was an impi on the Umguza just
below Government House, a small force was got together to
go out and ascertain the truth of the report. This force consisted
of twenty-one Scouts under Captain Grey and twenty-two
of the Africander Corps under Captain Van Niekerk,
Captains Nicholson and Howard Brown accompanying them,
so that there were only forty-five men and officers all told.</p>

<p class="i1">Leaving town before daylight on the Friday morning, this
little force crossed the stream on this side of Government
House just as the sun was rising. It then, after emerging
on to the high ground, turned to the right towards the
Umguza. Soon numbers of Kafirs were seen moving about
in the bush on the farther side of the river, who, when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
saw the white men advancing at once opened fire on them, at
a distance at first of about 800 yards. This fire was not
answered, but as soon as the Scouts and Africanders could be
thrown out in skirmishing order, they were ordered to advance
towards the river at a canter. On reaching it they at once
crossed at two different places, the Africanders being on the
right and Grey's Scouts on the left. When the top of the
farther bank was reached the white men found themselves
within 150 yards of a number of Matabele advancing
rapidly towards them in skirmishing order through the bush.
These latter at once fired a volley, all their bullets going high,
and then turned and ran as the horsemen came galloping
towards them. As Grey's Scouts got amongst them it was
seen that the line of skirmishers was supported by a large
body of men some distance in their rear, from which two
flanking parties had been thrown out on either side. Van
Niekerk charged with his men right on to the head of the left-hand
flanking party and drove it back, but Captain Grey
with his Scouts, whilst driving in the skirmishers on the main
body, passed the right-hand flanking party, which then
attempted to cut off his retreat to the river.</p>

<p class="i1">At once recognising that the natives were in force, and
that the number of men at his command was altogether too
small to cope with them, he gave the word to retire, and then
both the Scouts and Africanders got back across the river
again as quickly as possible, closely followed by the Kafirs.
On reaching a rise some few hundred yards on the near side
of the river, the white men halted, and dismounting kept the
Kafirs in check for a while, but it was soon seen that their
numbers were such that they would have been completely
surrounded, so, one man and three horses having already been
wounded, it was deemed advisable to retire and leave the
field for the time being in possession of the Matabele. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
wounded man was Mr. Harker, who was shot through the
leg, but eventually recovered without losing the limb. The
three horses that were wounded all died subsequently.</p>

<p class="i1">Upon reaching Bulawayo I at once had interviews with
Mr. Duncan and Colonel Napier, and convinced them both
that it was more necessary to establish a fort on the road
between Bulawayo and Fig Tree than to add one more to
the two already existing between Fig Tree and Mangwe, and
I then and there received instructions to bring my own
troop back again from Matoli, in order to build a fort at
Mabukitwani. I should have left the same evening, to rejoin
my men and carry out these orders, but the question arose as
to the best means of provisioning the garrisons of the various
forts, amounting altogether to 180 men. It was most inadvisable
that any more food-stuff should be sent out of Bulawayo at
this juncture than was absolutely necessary, so as there were
three Government mule waggons at different forts along the
road, I suggested that these should be sent down to Tati,
where I understood that there was a good deal of food-stuff
stored, to bring up full loads of the most necessary kinds of
provisions, the balance of which, when the garrisons of the
forts had been supplied with a month's rations, could be
brought on to Bulawayo. Colonel Napier at once telegraphed
to Mr. Vigers, who was in charge at Tati, to ascertain what
food supplies he had on hand, and requested me not to leave
Bulawayo until an answer had been received. I therefore
spent Saturday night in bed, instead of on horseback riding
down the Mangwe road. About eight o'clock on the following
morning, Sunday, 19th April, a horse came galloping into
town riderless, and with its saddle and bridle covered with
blood. This horse was soon identified as having belonged to
one of three men of the Africander Corps, who had left
Bulawayo on picket duty in the neighbourhood of Government 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
House on the preceding evening. It was subsequently
discovered that these poor fellows had been surprised and
killed by the Matabele early in the morning, two of their
horses being also killed or captured, whilst the third made
good its escape and galloped back into Bulawayo with a
bullet-wound through its neck. The names of the unfortunate
men were Heinemann, Van Zyl, and Montgomerie.</p>

<p class="i1">The excitement caused by this incident had scarcely subsided
when news was received that Colonel Napier's homestead
at Maatjiumschlopay, only about three miles to the south
of the town, was being attacked by a large force of Matabele.
At this homestead there were a large number of friendly
natives, mostly armed with assegais, and also sixteen white
men who occupied a small fort which had been built on the
top of a small kopje overlooking the farm.</p>

<p class="i1">The first news received was that the Matabele had carried
off a lot of cattle, killed a large number of the Friendlies, and
were now besieging the white men in their fort. A small
force of mounted men was therefore hastily got together and
sent out to their assistance under Captain Macfarlane. This
force consisted of a troop of the Africander Corps under
Captain Pittendrigh, a few of Grey's Scouts, and some men of
K troop under Captain Reid; about sixty troopers all
told, with a Maxim gun in charge of Lieutenant Biscoe. It
left town at about ten o'clock, taking the Tuli road.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time I had an appointment with Colonel Napier at
his office, to get the answer expected to the telegram sent the
day before to Mr. Vigers at Tati. However, on inquiry at
the office, I found that Colonel Napier was out, and that no reply
had yet been received from Tati. On asking where Colonel
Napier was, I was told that he had accompanied Captain
Macfarlane. Now I had been requested not to leave Bulawayo
until Colonel Napier had communicated to me the contents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of the telegraphic message he was expecting from Tati, and
therefore, believing that he had gone out with Captain Macfarlane's
patrol, and that I would not be able to make a start
for Matoli until he returned, I thought that I might as well
take a ride out and see what was going on too.</p>

<p class="i1">Major Armstrong very kindly lent me the pony which he
had ridden from Mangwe, which I knew was a very steady
animal, trained for shooting. It did not take me long to
saddle up, and I was soon riding hard on the tracks of Captain
Macfarlane's troopers. I came up with them on the race-course,
not far beyond the suburban stands, and learned from
the officer in command that the attack on Maatjiumschlopay
had been repulsed by the Friendlies, with the assistance of
the white men in garrison there. The Matabele had not been
in any force, and had evidently intended to sweep off a herd
of cattle which was kept on the farm, and which the sixteen
white men were there to protect.</p>

<p class="i1">No doubt the rebels were ignorant of the presence of these
latter, for they cleared off when they were fired upon, hotly
pursued by the Friendlies, who overtook and killed six of
their number with clubs and assegais.</p>

<p class="i1">As these marauders had had ample time to reach the thick
bush bordering the Umguza, where they would have been
able to scatter and hide, Captain Macfarlane determined to
waste no time in pursuing them, but to make a reconnaissance
down the Umguza towards Government House, in the
hope of coming across a larger body of rebels who would be
likely to make a stand.</p>

<p class="i1">We therefore crossed the Salisbury road and followed
down the bank of a stream which runs into the Umguza some
two and a half miles from Bulawayo, just beyond a deserted
farmhouse belonging to Mr. Colenbrander. The farmhouse
stands on a rising piece of ground, in the angle formed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
two streams, but is about 400 yards distant from the Umguza,
though close to its tributary.</p>

<p class="i1">When we got near the farmhouse, being still on the near
side of the stream we had been following, some Colonial Boys,
who proved to be scouts sent out by Mr. Colenbrander, came
up and informed Captain Macfarlane that there were a lot of
Matabele along the river, and that a number of them had
only just left the farmhouse opposite.</p>

<p class="i1">The right-hand flanking party, under Lieutenant Hook, had
now crossed the stream, so I galloped after them to get a look
round from the high ground. Standing near the house, we
could see large numbers of Kafirs spread out in skirmishing
order amongst the scrubby bush on the farther side of the
Umguza. As soon as they saw us, they at once commenced
their usual tactics, throwing out flanking parties on either
side, no doubt with the idea of surrounding us, whilst at the
same time skirmishers were sent forward from the centre,
evidently to take up a position in the bed of the river.</p>

<p class="i1">At this moment a messenger arrived recalling Lieutenant
Hook to the other side of the stream, and upon riding through
with him Captain Macfarlane informed me that, having just
heard that another impi was approaching from the direction
of Government House, he intended to take up his position on
a fairly open piece of ground, near the junction of the smaller
stream with the Umguza, and let the Kafirs attack him there,
his force being altogether too small to risk crossing to the
other side.</p>

<p class="i1">As we advanced the Kafirs opened fire on us, and a skirmishing
fight soon commenced. I was asked to take a few
of the Africanders across the smaller stream, so as to keep
the Kafirs from taking possession of it, which I at once proceeded
to do, but as I thus became separated from the main
body I can only give an account of our own little skirmish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">As we rode up the rising ground beyond the stream, some
Kafirs sent a few bullets whizzing amongst us from the
shelter of the river, and then as we still advanced they very
foolishly abandoned a good position and ran up the farther
bank, and then along the river in a line, and in such a manner
that if the one aimed at was missed, the next was very likely
to be hit. The men I had with me were all good shots, and
I saw several natives drop to our fire before they got round a
bend of the river. Keeping a sharp look-out on ahead, I
noticed a lot more coming down from the scrubby bush
beyond it and crossing to our side, and rightly divining that
their object was to advance up the valley behind the next
ridge and then close in on us, I called to the few men with
me to gallop at once to the top of the rise to prevent being
taken by surprise and fired on from above.</p>

<p class="i1">Just at this moment we were joined by Lieutenant Hook
and a few more men, and spreading out in skirmishing order, we
rode to the top of the rise. We were just in time to meet a
number of Kafirs—I daresay fifty or sixty altogether—making
for the same position from the opposite side. They were
right in the open, the nearest being within 150 yards of us.
Some were armed with guns and rifles, but many of them
had nothing but assegais and shields.</p>

<p class="i1">As soon as we appeared on the rise in front of them they
all stopped, and those with rifles fired on us, their bullets
nearly all going high, but on two of their number falling they
commenced to retreat towards a strip of thickish bush
which ran from near the bank of the Umguza river right up
behind Colenbrander's farmhouse. This bush was about 400
yards from the top of the ridge from which the men with me
were firing, and from its shelter a number of Kafirs were
answering us and covering the retreat of their men across the
valley. However, as the horses were quickly taken behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the ridge, and the men showed as little of themselves as
possible, their fire did us no harm. On the other hand,
several of the Kafirs fell to our shots before they reached the
cover of the bush. They made no attempt to run fast, but
went off crouching down at a slow trot. I myself was sitting
down with my back against a stone, and shooting as carefully
as possible, when a bullet struck a small stone close to my
left foot and ricochetted with a loud buzzing noise close past
poor Pat Whelan, a brave son of Erin, who had been with me
on the first patrol to the Matopos, and who, having come out
from Bulawayo on this day for the fun of the thing, thought
it his duty to keep near me. "That was a fair buzzer," said
Pat.</p>

<p class="i1">The Kafirs were now calling to one another, or some one
was giving them orders in the bush, and we could see that
they were all making up within its shelter towards the farmhouse.
Thinking that their idea was to get behind it, and
then fire on the position taken up by the Maxim, I gave the
word to the men with me to mount and take possession of it
first. This we promptly did, just getting there as the foremost
of the enemy were about half-way between the bush
and the house. They stopped and fired at us as before, and
then retired to the bush again, from which they kept up a
fusillade on the house, which, however, unless they had made
a heavy rush, we could have held against them if necessary;
but just then Lieutenant Moffat came up with a message
from Captain Macfarlane, requesting me to retire on his
position and endeavour to draw the Kafirs on to the Maxim.</p>

<p class="i1">As we withdrew from the house they at once came on out
of the bush, and when we got down to the stream they were
already firing at us from behind it, and, their advance not
being opposed, some of them came right down into the bed of
the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">At this time there was a really good chance for the
Maxim to do some execution, for although the Kafirs were
nowhere in masses, there was a straggling line of a couple of
hundred of them right out in the open, and not more than
400 yards from the gun. But when the word was given to
fire it most unfortunately jammed at the sixth shot, and the
Kafirs had to be driven back by rifle fire. The cause of the
mishap was that a cartridge-case had broken off at the rim
in the barrel of the Maxim, rendering it for the time being
useless. The natives now again commenced to try and get
round us on both sides, and it being reported that the other
impi was advancing from the direction of Government House,
Captain Macfarlane gave the word to retire.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time I was with Captain Reid and the men of his
troop, helping to keep the Kafirs from crossing the Umguza
at a point where they were trying to do so a few hundred yards
below us, and it was here that a man named Boyes, of the
Africander Corps, was killed. He, with another man, seems to
have gone down close to where the smaller stream joined the
river, and was shot from the cover of the bank right through
the chest, his horse being shot at the same time I think. He
fell dead at once, and his companion galloped back to the
main body.</p>

<p class="i1">Captain Macfarlane was already retiring, and the order
had come to Captain Reid to do the same, acting as flanking
party to the right of the main body. Unfortunately, the
death of Boyes was not reported to the commanding officer
until the patrol was half-way to Bulawayo, so that the poor
fellow's corpse fell into the hands of the Kafirs. The only
other casualty was one man badly wounded in the knee.
Considering the number of bullets that pass pretty near to
every one engaged in a small skirmish such as I have
described, it is wonderful how few men get actually hit. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
fact seems to be that in a running fight, when they are
flurried and hustled, Kafirs cannot get the time they require
to take good aim, and if you are near them they always shoot
over you. The golden rule is to scatter out, each man firing
independently in the Boer fashion.</p>

<p class="i1">But although Kafirs shoot very badly if hurried and
kept moving, many of them are very fair shots if they can
get all the time they require for aiming, as they can in hilly
country, where they can take up positions behind rocks, from
which they can fire at their enemy at their leisure and without
exposing themselves.</p>

<p class="i1">On the day of which I have been speaking, some of them
with whom my little advanced party was engaged were
firing at us with some very peculiar bullets, which I think
had probably been made by first putting a stone into the
mould, and then pouring lead on to it, forming a very rough
irregular projectile. At any rate you could hear these bullets
coming on with a loud buzzing noise, which increased in
intensity until they passed with a peculiar whizzing sound.
The trouble was one did not know which way to dodge, for
as you could hear them approaching but could not see them, it
would have been as easy to dodge into one as out of its way.</p>

<p class="i1">As our small force retired the bush became more and
more open, so the Kafirs made no attempt to follow us.
I do not think that they realised that the Maxim was out
of order, and if not they probably thought that the retreat
was a ruse to draw them into more open ground. What
their losses were it is difficult to say, but I think that the
small advance party to which I had attached myself could
not have killed less than twenty; indeed, I think I saw quite
that number fall. My friend Pat Whelan had fired away
almost all his cartridges, and on examining my belt I found
that I had nineteen less than I came out with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">However, the Kafirs again retained their position, and it
was evident that their numbers were so great—we having
only engaged their advanced skirmishing line—that it would
not be safe to cross the Umguza and attack them on their
own ground without a considerable force, both of foot and
horsemen; the latter to work in the more open ground, and
the former to drive them out of patches of bush.</p>

<p class="i1">Before returning to Bulawayo, Captain Macfarlane took a
sweep round across the open ground in the direction of Dr.
Sauer's house, and we there came in sight of the impi which
had been reported early in the day. The main body was
standing in a dense black mass on the top of a ridge just
below Government House, their skirmishing lines being
thrown out on either side, and in advance of the centre.
Now the fact that this impi had stood idly by, not exactly
watching, but at any rate listening to the firing that had been
going on during the skirmish between their compatriots and
the white men, shows, I think, the extraordinary want of
combination amongst them, of which I have before spoken,
and which has been one of the features of this campaign.</p>

<p class="chapsum">A force under command of Colonel Napier sent against the rebels at the
Umguza—Force retire without fighting—I obtain leave to join a patrol sent out
to the Umguza under Captain Bisset—Matabele dispute our advance—I

and men—Patrol retires to Bulawayo.</p>


<p><span class="sc">On</span> the way back to Bulawayo we were met by Colonel
Napier and Captain Nicholson, and it was arranged that as
strong a force as could be spared from the town should be
sent out again to the Umguza on the morrow, under the command
of the former gentleman. Accordingly, at about eleven
o'clock on Monday, 20th April, a force of two hundred and
thirty white men and one hundred colonial natives, all told,
left Bulawayo for the scene of the previous day's skirmish.
With the force were a seven-pounder, a Hotchkiss, and a
Maxim. Captain Macfarlane had command of the right flank,
and Captain Van Niekerk of the left; whilst I was in charge
of a detachment of men on foot, drawn from various corps,
and a body of Colenbrander's natives were under the command
of Captain Cardigan.</p>

<p class="i1">This was a most disappointing day for all those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
wanted a little excitement, as the Matabele and the officers
commanding our column were at cross purposes; the former
wanting the white men to cross the river and fight them in
the bush, and the latter being in favour of the Kafirs coming
through to their side, and attacking a position defended with
artillery. The result was that there was no fight.</p>

<p class="i1">The decision not to cross the Umguza may have been a
wise one, but it was not popular with the men, who marched
back to town in a very dejected frame of mind; so strong was
the feeling, indeed, that it was decided to send out another
patrol to the Umguza on the following Wednesday, and as I
was anxious to see a good blow struck at them, I asked Mr.
Duncan and Colonel Napier to give me another day's leave of
absence from my work of superintending the building of forts
and patrolling along the Mangwe road, in order that I might
take part in the engagement. At the same time I sent a wire
to Captain Molyneux at Fig Tree, requesting him to forward
instructions to Lieutenant Grenfell at Matoli to march back
with the men of my troop to Mabukitwani, where it had
been decided that we were to build a fort, and where I undertook
to meet him, unless anything unforeseen should happen,
on Thursday evening.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus on Wednesday morning, 22nd April, for the fourth
time a small force marched out of Bulawayo, in order to try
and dislodge the Kafirs from their position on the Umguza,
in the immediate vicinity of the town. This patrol was put
under the command of Captain Bisset, a gentleman who
had had some previous experience of native warfare in Basutoland
and Zululand.</p>

<p class="i1">The patrol consisted of twenty Scouts under Captain Grey;
forty men under Captain Van Niekerk; twenty under Captain
Meikle, and twenty under Captain Brand, making, with some
twenty others unattached, about one hundred and twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
mounted men, with a Hotchkiss and a Maxim under Lieutenant
Walsh. Besides these mounted troops, there were a
detachment of one hundred colonial Kafirs and Zulus recruited
by Mr. Colenbrander, and some friendly Kafirs who,
however, were only armed with assegais, and who took no
part in the fight. I was asked to take command of the
Colonial Boys, which I could hardly do, as they had their own
trusted officers with them, but I accompanied these gentlemen,
and undertook to assist them in leading their men to the
attack. Dr. Vigne went in charge of the ambulance waggon
which accompanied the patrol.</p>

<p class="i1">After much valuable time had been lost in looking for the
impi which was said to be behind the brickfields, but which
as a matter of fact had never been there, we turned towards
the Umguza, passing at the back of Government House.
Here an accident occurred to the Hotchkiss limber carriage,
which delayed us for more than an hour, and although the
broken shaft was temporarily tied up with a chain, so that the
gun could be drawn along, it was rendered useless for action
until the damage done could be properly repaired.</p>

<p class="i1">On proceeding we changed our direction and made straight
for the Umguza, and it was soon evident that the Kafirs
intended to dispute our advance, as they commenced to fire on
us from the low ridges covered with scrubby bush which here
border the river on both sides. Captain Van Niekerk and
his Africanders were soon hotly engaged on the left flank, and
as the Kafirs were in possession of some ridges just in front
of us as well, I was asked to advance with the Colonial Boys
from the centre, and endeavour to chase them across the river.
My instructions were to attack and, if possible, drive them
before me, but to retire on the guns if I found them too
strong.</p>

<p class="i1">The boys came on capitally, led by their officers, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
all mounted, and we soon drove all the Matabele in this part
of the field through the Umguza, and following them up at
once, pursued them for about a mile over some stony ridges
covered with scrubby bush.</p>

<p class="i1">Up to this time I had not fired a shot, as I had been principally
engaged in encouraging the Colonial Boys to come on
quickly and give our enemies no breathing time. But by
this time we had got right up amongst them, and I began to
use my rifle.</p>

<p class="i1">A number of the Matabele had built little fortifications of
loose stones near the bank of the river, from behind the
shelter of which they fired on us; but the warlike Amakosa
and Zulus charged them most gallantly, and engaging them
hand to hand drove them out of their shelters into the river,
and killed many of them in the water. Several of the
Colonial Boys were here wounded with assegais and axes, but
none were killed.</p>

<p class="i1">It was at this time that I saw John Grootboom, a Xosa
Kafir—who has distinguished himself for bravery on many
occasions both during the first war and the present campaign—galloping
after a Matabele just in front of me, who was
armed only with assegais and shield. As the horse came
upon him he ducked down, and only just escaped a blow on
the head from John's rifle, which was dealt with such vigour
that the rider lost his balance and fell off, and his foot catching
in the stirrup, he was dragged along the road for some
yards. If the Matabele had but kept his presence of mind
and been quick, he might have assegaied his antagonist easily,
and possibly would have done so had not Captain Fynn and
myself been close to him.</p>

<p class="i1">We had now got the Matabele fairly on the run in our
part of the field, and the only ones who were still firing at us
were a party who had taken shelter in a bend of the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
under cover of the bank, some three hundred yards ahead of
us. I was just going with some of the Colonial Boys to
dislodge them, when I saw Grey's Scouts charging down on
them from the other side of the river. Finding themselves
attacked from this quarter, the Matabele left their cover and
ran out into the open in large numbers, exposing themselves
to a heavy fire which thinned their ranks every instant.</p>

<p class="i1">The position was now this.—The Matabele had been
driven from the banks of the river, and two or three hundred
of them, panic-stricken and demoralised, were running in a
crowd across some undulating ground, but scantily covered
with bush, and had only Captain Meikle and Captain Brand
been sent in support of the Colonial Boys and the Scouts, they
might have galloped in amongst them, and could not have
failed to kill a very large number of them. But no;
although these officers and their men were chafing and
cursing at their enforced inactivity, they were kept idly
standing round the Maxim doing nothing, which was all the
more inexcusable as Captain Van Niekerk with his forty
Africanders had by this time silenced the enemy's fire on the
left flank, and there was no farther apprehension of any
heavy attack from that quarter. At any rate, one of the best
chances of inflicting a heavy loss on the rebels which has
occurred during the campaign was not taken advantage of.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time, that is just when Grey's Scouts were driving
the Matabele out of the river, some one told me that an order
had come recalling the Colonial Boys, so I galloped along the
line of those that were farthest in advance, and told them
that the order had been given to retire. Then I thought
that before going back myself I would gallop forwards and
try and get a shot or two at some of the Kafirs armed with
guns, who were retreating from the fire of Grey's Scouts.</p>

<p class="i1">In front of me lay a piece of perfectly open ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
extending along the Umguza, some 200 yards broad,
whilst from the edge of the open to the left the country
was undulating and very scantily covered with low bush.
The pony I was riding was the same that had been lent to
me on the previous Sunday, and he had proved himself so
absolutely steady, with rifles going off all round him, and
bullets pinging and buzzing past him, that the last thing I
thought of was that he might now play me false and run
away. However this is what happened. I had dismounted
and was sitting down to get a steady shot when some one
said close behind me, "Look out, they're coming down on us
from the left." I did not know that any one was near me,
but on getting up and looking round, saw one of the officers
of the Colonial Boys—now Captain, then Lieutenant Windley—close
behind me. At the same time I saw Grey's Scouts
retreating on the other side of the river, and recognised that
Windley and I were a long way ahead of John Grootboom
and five or six other Xosa Kafirs, who were the only
members of the corps I could see, and who were also retiring;
whilst I also saw that some of the Matabele we had been
chasing had rallied, and seeing two white men alone, were
coming down on us as hard as they could, with the evident
intention of cutting off our retreat. However, they were still
some 250 yards from us, and could I but have mounted my
pony, we could have galloped away from them and rejoined
the Colonial Boys easily enough.</p>

<p class="i1">A few bullets were again beginning to ping past us, so I
did not want to lose any time, but before I could take my
pony by the bridle he suddenly threw up his head, and
spinning round trotted off, luckily running in the direction
from which we had come. Being so very steady a pony, I
imagine that a bullet must have grazed him and startled him
into playing me this sorry trick at such a very inconvenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
moment. "Come on as hard as you can, and I'll catch your
horse and bring him back to you," said Windley, and started
off after the faithless steed. But the brute would not allow
himself to be caught, and when his pursuer approached him,
broke from a trot into a gallop, and finally showed a clean
pair of heels.</p>

<p class="i1">When my pony went off with Windley after him, leaving
me, comparatively speaking, <i>planté là</i>, the Kafirs thought
they had got me, and commenced to shout out encouragingly
to one another and also to make a kind of hissing noise, like
the word "jee" long drawn out. All this time I was
running as hard as I could after Windley and my runaway
horse. As I ran carrying my rifle at the trail, I felt in my
bandoleer with my left hand to see how many cartridges
were still at my disposal, and found that I had fired away all
but two of the thirty I had come out with, one being left in
the belt and the other in my rifle. Glancing round, I saw
that the foremost Kafirs were gaining on me fast, though had
this incident occurred in 1876 instead of 1896, with the start
I had got I would have run away from any of them.</p>

<p class="i1">Windley, after galloping some distance, realised that it was
useless wasting any more time trying to catch my horse, and
like a good fellow came back to help me; and had he not
done so, let me here say that the present history would never
have been written, for nothing could possibly have saved me
from being overtaken, surrounded, and killed. When
Windley came up to me he said "Get up behind me; there's
no time to lose," and pulled his foot out of the left stirrup for
me to mount. Without any unnecessary loss of time, I
caught hold of the pommel of the saddle, and got my foot
into the iron, but it seemed to me that my weight might pull
Windley and the saddle right round, so, as a glance over my
shoulder showed me that the foremost Kafirs were now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
within 100 yards of us, I hastily pulled my foot out of the
stirrup again, and shifting my rifle to my left hand caught
hold of the thong round the horse's neck with my right, and
told Windley to let him go. He was a big strong animal,
and as, by keeping my arm well bent, I held my body close
up to him, he got me along at a good pace, and we began to
gain on the Kafirs. They now commenced to shoot, but being
more or less blown by hard running, they shot very badly,
though they put the bullets all about us. Two struck just by my
foot, and one knocked the heel of Windley's boot off. If they
could only have hit the horse, they would have got both of us.</p>

<p class="i1">After having gained a little on our pursuers, Windley,
thinking I must have been getting done up, asked me to try
again to mount behind him: no very easy matter when you
have a big horse to get on to and are holding a rifle in your
right hand. However, with a desperate effort I got up behind
him; but the horse, being unaccustomed to such a proceeding,
immediately commenced to buck, and in spite of spurring
would not go forwards, and the Kafirs, seeing our predicament,
raised a yell and came on again with renewed ardour.</p>

<p class="i1">Seeing that if I stuck on the horse behind Windley we
should both of us very soon lose our lives, I flung myself off
in the middle of a buck, and landed right on the back of my
neck and shoulders. Luckily I was not stunned or in any
way hurt, and was on my legs and ready to run again with
my hand on the thong round the horse's neck in a very
creditably short space of time. My hat had fallen off, but I
never left go of my rifle, and as I didn't think it quite the
best time to be looking for a hat, I left it, all adorned with
the colours of my troop as it was, to be picked up by the
enemy, by whom it has no doubt been preserved as a souvenir
of my presence amongst them.</p>

<p class="i1">And now another spurt brought us almost up to John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Grootboom and the five or six Colonial Boys who were with
him, and I called to John to halt the men and check the
Matabele who were pursuing us, by firing a volley past us at
them. This they did, and it at once had the desired effect,
the Kafirs who were nearest to us hanging back and waiting
for those behind to join them. In the meantime Windley and
I joined John Grootboom's party, and old John at once gave
me his horse, which, as I was very much exhausted and out
of breath, I was very glad to get. Indeed I was so tired by
the hardest run I had ever had since my old elephant-hunting
days, that it was quite an effort to mount. I was now safe,
except that a few bullets were buzzing about, for soon after
getting up to John Grootboom we joined the main body of
the Colonial Boys, and then, keeping the Matabele at bay,
retired slowly towards the position defended by the Maxim.
Our enemies, who had been so narrowly baulked of their
expected prey, followed us to the top of a rise, well within
range of the gun, but disappeared immediately a few sighting
shots were fired at them.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus ended a very disagreeable little experience, which
but for the cool courage of Captain Windley would undoubtedly
have ended fatally to myself. Like many brave
men, Captain Windley is so modest that I should probably
offend him were I to say very much about him; but at any
rate I shall never forget the service he did me at the risk of
his own life that day on the Umguza, whilst the personal
gallantry he has always shown throughout the present
campaign as a leader of our native allies has earned for him
such respect and admiration that they have nicknamed him
"Inkunzi," the Bull, the symbol of strength and courage.
But Captain Windley was not the only man who performed a
brave and self-denying deed on this somewhat eventful day,
as I shall now proceed to relate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">When the Scouts were recalled, and commenced to retire
from the Umguza, after having driven a body of natives from
its shelter, as I have already related, they were suddenly fired
on by a party of Matabele who had taken up a position
amongst some bush to the left of their line of retreat. The
foremost amongst the Scouts galloped past this ambush, but
Captain Grey with a few of those in the rear halted and
returned the enemy's fire. Trooper Wise was the first man
hit, and seems to have received his wound from behind just
as he was mounting his horse, as the bullet struck him high
in the back, and travelling up the shoulder-blade, came out
near the collar-bone. At this instant Wise's horse stumbled,
and then, recovering himself, broke away from its rider,
galloping straight back to town, and leaving the wounded
man on the ground. A brave fellow named Baxter at once
dismounted and put Wise on his own horse, thus saving the
latter's life, but, as it proved, thereby sacrificing his own.
Captain Grey and Lieutenant Hook at once went to Baxter's
assistance, and they got him along as fast as they could, but
the Kafirs had now closed on them, and were firing out of the
bush at very close quarters. Lieutenant Hook was shot from
behind, the bullet entering the right buttock and coming out
near the groin, but most luckily, though severing the sciatic
nerve, just missing both the thigh-bone and the femoral
artery. Nearly at the same time, too, a bullet just grazed
Captain Grey's forehead, half-stunning him for an instant.
"Texas" Long, a well-known member of the Scouts, then
went to Baxter's assistance, and was helping him along, when
a bullet struck the dismounted man in the side, and he at
once let go of Long's stirrup leather and fell to the ground.
No further assistance was then possible, and poor Baxter was
killed by the Kafirs immediately afterwards. Whilst these
brave deeds were being performed, Lieutenant Fred Crewe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
with some others of the Scouts, amongst whom I may mention
Button and Radermayer, were keeping the Kafirs in check
and covering the retreat of the wounded men. Just as
Lieutenant Hook got near to Crewe, his horse was shot
through the fetlock and buttock at the same time, and rolling
over, threw Hook to the ground, causing him at the same
time to drop his rifle. Hook got on his legs and was hobbling
forwards when Crewe said to him, "Why don't you pick up
your rifle?" "I can't," was the answer; "I'm too badly
wounded." "Are you wounded, old chap?" said Crewe;
"then take my horse, and I'll try and get out of it on foot."
Crewe then assisted Hook to mount his horse, and fought his
way back on foot, only escaping with his life by a miracle,
keeping several Kafirs who were very near him, but who had
no guns, at bay with his revolver, whilst he retreated backwards.
So near were these men to him, that one of them, as
he turned, threw a heavy knob-kerry at him, which struck him
a severe blow in the back. Nothing could have saved him
had not the Kafirs been constantly kept in check by the
steady fire of Radermayer, Button, Jack Stuart, and others of
the Scouts, and also by a cross-fire from some of the Colonial
Boys, directed by Captain Fynn and Lieutenant Mullins.</p>

<p class="i1">The splendid gallantry and devotion to one another shown
by Captain Grey and his officers and men on this day will ever
be remembered in Rhodesia as amongst the bravest of the
brave deeds performed by the Colonists in the suppression of
the present rebellion. Such acts, too, speak for themselves,
and bear eloquent if silent testimony against the cruel and
malicious calumnies on the character of the white settlers in
Matabeleland which have so frequently disgraced the pages
of a widely-read, if generally-despised, weekly journal.</p>

<p class="i1">As soon as Grey's Scouts and the Colonial Boys had
reached the guns, these latter were limbered up and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
whole patrol retired slowly on Bulawayo, the Matabele
making no attempt to follow. Indeed their loss must have
been severe, and had Grey's Scouts and the Colonial Boys
only been supported instead of being recalled, the Matabele
would never have rallied, but would have been kept on the
run and killed in large numbers by the mounted men. At
least this is my view, and it has been thoroughly borne out
by the experience gained in subsequent fights during this
campaign.</p>

<p class="i1">Our loss on this day was, Baxter killed and Wise and
Hook wounded amongst Grey's Scouts, while five or six of
the Colonial Boys were wounded, but none dangerously.
Wise has long ago recovered from his wound, and Lieutenant
Hook is on a fair way to do so. I have forgotten to mention
that my horse must have been captured by the Matabele, as
he did not return to Bulawayo, and has not since been heard
of. The lucky savage into whose hands he fell became
possessed at the same time of a very good saddle and bridle,
and a brand new Government coat.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Telegraph wire to Fig Tree Fort cut—Patrol sent out to escort coach—I join
Captain Mainwaring's patrol—Repair telegraph wire—I rejoin my troop
at Dawe's store—Two murdered white men found near Bulawayo—Fort
Marquand—Lieutenant Grenfell's account of the fight at Umguza.</p>


<p><span class="sc">On</span> our arrival in town we heard that the wire was down or
had been cut by the natives between Bulawayo and Fig
Tree Fort. A patrol was therefore at once organised to
proceed along the telegraph line, repair the break, and then
go on to Fig Tree in order to act as an escort back to town
for a coach now due containing a large and valuable consignment
of rifles. This patrol was under the command of
Captain Mainwaring, and consisted of thirty-five men of his
own troop of the Bulawayo Police Force, and twenty-two men
of the Matabele Mounted Police under Inspector Southey.</p>

<p class="i1">Being due at Mabukitwani on Thursday evening, I left
town early on the morning of that day, and joining Captain
Mainwaring travelled with him down the telegraph line.
We found the wire broken about three and a half miles from
Bulawayo. One of the poles had been chopped down
evidently with small-bladed native axes, whilst the wire
itself had been cut and the insulator broken.</p>

<p class="i1">After the wire had been repaired we continued our
journey, and reached the Khami river at about 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>,
where we remained till about seven o'clock. Then, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
horses and men being rested and refreshed, we saddled-up
and rode on to Mr. Dawe's store, which is about half a mile
from the old kraal of Mabukitwani. Here I heard that Lieutenant
Grenfell had arrived with my troop from Matoli the
same evening, and was encamped near the mule stable on the
further side of the stream; so bidding good-bye to Captain
Mainwaring, who decided to camp near the store, I at once
rejoined my own men.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning Captain Mainwaring proceeded
to Fig Tree, where he had not to wait long for the coach
which he had come to meet, as he got back to my camp with
it on Saturday evening. There were 123 rifles on board
from which the locks and pins had been taken—each man of
the escort carrying three of each—in order that, in the event
of the coach being captured by an overwhelming force of
Matabele, the rifles should be useless to them. However,
both coach and escort reached Bulawayo safely, no rebels
having been met with.</p>

<p class="i1">When about four miles from town they discovered the
bodies of two white men lying on the roadside about 150
yards from their waggon. They had evidently been surprised
by the rebels, and had made a bolt for life towards the road.
The bodies had been terribly mutilated and hacked about,
and seemed to have been lying where they were found for at
least forty-eight hours. They were examined by Captain
Mainwaring and Inspector Southey, as was also the waggon,
but nothing was discovered by which to identify the murdered
men except a branding iron. It was, however, subsequently
ascertained that they were two Dutch transport riders named
Potgieter and Fourie.</p>

<p class="i1">Strangely enough, these are the only white men who have
been murdered on the main road from Bulawayo to Mafeking
during the present insurrection, and it is noteworthy that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
they were not travelling along the road, but had been living
for some time in their waggon some little distance away from
it. I have no doubt that they were murdered by the party
of rebels by whom the telegraph wire was cut on Wednesday,
22nd April. These men probably discovered their whereabouts
the same evening, and were thus able to surprise and
murder them during the night, or more probably at daylight
on the following morning. The murderers were followers of
Babian, one of the two envoys who visited England with Mr.
E. A. Maund in 1899. The second envoy, Umsheti, is dead,
or he, too, would be found in the ranks of the insurgents.</p>

<p class="i1">On Friday morning Lieutenant Grenfell and Mr. Norton
rode into Bulawayo on business, and on the following day the
former gentleman took part in the memorable fight with the
Matabele on the Umguza, when for the first time the rebels
were driven from their position in the immediate vicinity of
the town, near Government House, which they have never
since reoccupied.</p>

<p class="i1">During Mr. Grenfell's absence, Messrs. Blöcker, Marquand,
and myself chose a site for a fort on a kopje near the site
of the old kraal of Mabukitwani, from the top of which a
magnificent view of the surrounding country was obtainable,
whilst with a certain amount of work the kopje itself could
be turned into an impregnable fortress. Now that work has
been accomplished, and Fort Marquand will long remain as a
memento of the present struggle in Matabeleland. I christened
it Fort Marquand, after my lieutenant of that name,
whom, he being an architect by profession, I put in charge
of the working parties, so that the fort was built entirely
under his direction and superintendence, and whosoever may
care to examine it will see for himself that it is a very good
fort, built with great care and sagacity.</p>

<p class="i1">On Monday evening Lieutenant Grenfell and Mr. Norton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
returned to Mabukitwani, in company with a detachment of
the Africander Corps which had been sent down under
Commandant Barnard to meet Earl Grey, who was expected
by the next coach. From Lieutenant Grenfell and Commandant
Barnard and his men I heard all about the fight on the
previous day at the Umguza, as they had all taken part in it.
All agreed that the Kafirs had suffered very heavy loss, and
been most signally discomfited, and Lieutenant Grenfell was
kind enough to write for me the following account of the
engagement:—</p>

<p class="i1">"On Friday, 24th of April, it was not difficult to discern
that a determined move against the Kafirs on the Umguza
was in contemplation. The situation was getting unbearable,
the town being surrounded by the Matabele, and the operations
against them with a view to clearing the country round
Bulawayo not having hitherto been at all successful. In
fact, an uncomfortable feeling was prevalent that we were in
process of being closed in upon every side.</p>

<p class="i1">"It was therefore with great satisfaction that we learnt
this Friday night that Captain Macfarlane was to be given as
many men as could be spared, two guns, and a free hand,
and go out in the morning. Great was the scrimmaging for
horses among the unattached, unexpectedly sudden the
popularity of the remount officer. There is a good deal to be
said in favour of fighting when the state of affairs is such
that you can go out after morning coffee to a certain find,
with every chance of a gallop and a kill, and return to a late
breakfast at say 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> There were rumours, too, that this
time we really meant business, and that the natives would
be encouraged to surround us on all sides, in order to give
every opportunity to the machine guns and rifle fire.</p>

<p class="i1">"Such were the directions actually given by Captain
Macfarlane to his officers, when on the march, and the tactics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
proved to be sound enough. The patrol consisted of 35
Grey's Scouts under Captain Grey; 25 B troop under Captain
Fynn; 15 of Captain Dawson's troop; 35 of the Africander
Corps under Commandant Van Rensburg; 100 Colenbrander's
Cape Boys under Captain Cardigan, and 60 to 70 Friendlies
under Chief Native Commissioner Taylor; 1 Hotchkiss and
1 Maxim under Captain Rixon, and an ambulance with
stretchers under Dr. Vigne; making in all some 120 whites
and about 170 Colonial Boys and Friendlies all told, all under
the command of Captain Macfarlane. Mr. Duncan, Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Spreckley, Captain Nicholson, Town Major Scott, Captain
Wrey, and several other unattached officers and scouts, also
accompanied the force. It is worth mentioning that Messrs.
F. G. Hammond, Stewart, Anderson, Farquhar jr., and two or
three more, shouldered their rifles and marched out on foot,
in order to participate in the day's work.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i_171.jpg" id="i_171.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_171.jpg"
        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CAPTAIN R. MACFARLANE.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">"The patrol left Bulawayo at 7.30 in the morning of the
25th of April, and proceeded in a north-easterly direction,
taking the road to the right of the scene of the recent engagements
on the Umguza river. The Scouts went on ahead
as usual, the Africanders opening out on the left, and Captain
Dawson taking command of the right flanking party, the
guns bringing up the rear with an ambulance waggon and
the Friendlies. This order was kept until a small bare
eminence was reached on which stood four old walls, the
wreck of a small farmhouse some three miles out of Bulawayo.
There was a circuit of bush in front of this position, then the
Umguza river, and beyond that rocky ground with thick
bush rising from the river, the lines of the native "scherms"
showing up black on the heights in the distance.</p>

<p class="i1">"Up to now nothing had been seen of the enemy, only some
smoke from their fires. The Scouts rode down to the river
with orders to draw the enemy on, while the rest of the men
took up their places round the two guns. The position was
very suitable for both the Maxim and the Hotchkiss; but
afforded absolutely no cover for the men. The rebels, several
hundred in number, no sooner saw the Scouts than they
streamed down to the river, shouting out a loud challenge to
come on, which was answered by our side. The Scouts drew
back slowly, bringing the Kafirs well on, but were finally
driven in on our position with a rush, and the Kafirs pulled
up about 200 yards off in the bush, firing very rapidly.
Bullets of all sorts came whistling along, from elephant-
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>guns,
Martinis, Winchesters, and Lee-Metfords, and for about
an hour things were decidedly unpleasant, though up to this
time we had only one man killed and one wounded. Our
firing was incessant, and the shooting, though mostly at long
range, very steady, and as effective probably as our exposed
position and the cover afforded our assailants by the bush
would allow. After the rebels had made two determined
efforts to approach the Maxim, in both of which they were
foiled, their fire slackened, and they apparently sent their
best marksmen to the front to see what they could do.</p>

<p class="i1">"At this juncture, however, Captain Macfarlane ordered
the Africanders to charge those on our left, and the brilliant
manner in which this was carried out will not soon be
forgotten by those who witnessed it. The enemy had cover
here behind some rocky ridges, but the Africanders rode them
out of this ground in the cheeriest way possible—they use
rather more "noise" fighting than the Britishers do—and
sent them flying over the river, killing no fewer than seventy-four
at the crossing, and completely breaking up that wing of
the enemy's line. The Hotchkiss planted several shells very
well among the flying natives; whilst on our side only one
horse was lost in the charge.</p>

<p class="i1">"About this time the Scouts were ordered to drive off the
rebels to our front, and in this they succeeded admirably,
but owing to the bad ground they had three men wounded.
Lovett was shot here, and subsequently died from the effects
of his wound, whilst John Grootboom, a very plucky colonial
native, well known in Rhodesia, was also hit in two places
while trying to drive some natives out of a donga.</p>

<p class="i1">"Meanwhile Captain Dawson with his men on the right
had been holding his own under a galling fire in open
ground, unable to have a good shot at the enemy who were in
the bush. They were having a very warm time of it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
had lost two men killed and one wounded, when Burnham
was ordered to clear the bush with 100 of the Taylor's
Friendlies, wearing red capes and carrying assegais. The
charge was successful, and, backed up by Captain Taylor
and Colenbrander's Cape Boys armed with rifles, the Friendlies
cleared the bush and relieved Dawson from the hidden enemy.</p>

<p class="i1">"About this time a message arrived from Captain
Colenbrander that a fresh impi from the west meant to
attack us, and sure enough they turned up very soon after,
but seeing how the others had fared they kept fully half a
mile off, sending a number of shots after the Africanders,
whom they tried to cut off. The Maxim and Hotchkiss, however,
kept them from coming nearer. The main body of the
enemy having now partially reformed, the Africanders went to
assist the Scouts, and the enemy were driven off fully two miles,
one of our men and one horse being wounded in the sortie.</p>

<p class="i1">"Captain Macfarlane thought it was now time to get home,
as the wounded would take some time to see to, and there
was a chance of his having to fight his way back to town;
so orders were given for the ambulance to prepare to return
to Bulawayo, and the whole column marched back in good
order, having had by far the most successful day since the
commencement of the rebellion. Our loss was four white
men killed and four wounded, two Cape Boys and one
Friendly wounded, one horse and one mule killed. It is very
difficult to estimate the number of natives engaged, but there
were probably at least as many as 2000 in all opposed to us.
How many were killed it is difficult to say, but from the
bodies which were counted, and from the reports of the
wounded brought in by Captain Colenbrander and his boys,
who were over the ground in the afternoon, the enemy's loss
must have been considerable. A vidette party of four
mounted men, who were sent out to Government House in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
morning, allowed themselves to be surprised and surrounded
by the rebels, and one, unfortunately, got killed, namely
Trooper B. Parsons of D troop, the other three just escaping
with their lives.</p>

<p class="i1">"After the return of the column in the afternoon from the
Umguza, a small patrol under Lieutenant Boggie, consisting
of thirty dismounted men of C troop, fifty of Colenbrander's
Cape Boys, and ten of Grey's Scouts mounted, with one Maxim
gun, went out in the direction of Sauer's house, and turning
to the left, past Government House and Gifford's house, picked
up Trooper Parsons' body, and returned to town via the
Brickfields, not having seen any of the enemy. A seven-pounder
was placed in position on the rise at the back of
Williams' buildings, trained ready on to the ridge at the left
of Government House, in order to shell the position if
necessary. After the return of the patrol the Observatory
reported the appearance of a large body of the rebels, who
came over the ridge to the east of Government House down
as far as the spruit. Trooper Edward Appleyard, seriously
wounded on the Umguza in the morning, died on Saturday
night, and at 11.30 on Sunday morning his body, together
with those of Troopers Whitehouse, Gordon, and Parsons,
was accorded a military funeral."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lieutenant Grenfell</span> having brought me a despatch on
Monday evening, acquainting me that my presence was again
required in Bulawayo, I handed over the command of Fort
Marquand to him on the following morning, and rode in to
town alone, meeting Lieutenant Parkin and a second escort
which had been sent down to meet Earl Grey at the Khami
river.</p>

<p class="i1">On arriving at Matabele, Wilson's farm, six miles from
Bulawayo, I found Captain Dawson with his troop and a lot
of the "Friendlies" busily engaged in building a fort on a
commanding position some four hundred yards away from the
homestead and mule stables. With Captain Dawson, too,
were my old friends, the well-known American Scouts Burnham
and Ingram, and that very plucky English Scout Mr.
Swinburne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Although this detachment had only arrived here on the
previous day, very considerable progress had already been
made with the fort, which I was very pleased to find was
being built at this place, as I had long advocated it, as also
that another should be established at the Khami river,
about half-way between Wilson's farm and Fort Marquand.</p>

<p class="i1">This last link in the chain of forts between Bulawayo and
Mangwe did not come into existence until some few days
later, and only then could it be said that it was possible to
have the road properly patrolled. Whilst resting my horse
for half an hour at Dawson's Fort I heard more details from
him and the Scouts concerning the fight on the Umguza on
the previous Saturday, which they considered to be the
greatest reverse which the Matabele had yet suffered; or
perhaps it would be fairer to say the only reverse, since,
although, in every encounter their losses must have been very
heavy compared with those of the whites, yet this was the
first time that they had deemed it expedient to retreat from
their position after the fight was over.</p>

<p class="i1">On reaching Bulawayo, however, I found that, although
the impis which for the last ten days had been encamped
along the Umguza in the immediate neighbourhood of the
town had now moved some miles farther down the river, yet
parties of them were still hanging about ready to murder any
defenceless persons that they might be able to surprise, even
on the very outskirts of the town, as was sufficiently proved
by the fact that on the very morning of my arrival, that is
on Tuesday, 28th April, several coolies had been murdered in
their vegetable gardens just beyond the native location.</p>

<p class="i1">The following account of this affair I have taken over from
the <i>Matabele Times</i> of 2nd May, by kind permission of the
editor: "On their arrival in camp on Tuesday morning after
night duty in the laager, the Mounted Police found a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of terrified coolies awaiting them, who informed them that
they had been attacked by a large body of Matabele at their
vegetable gardens, situated about two miles beyond the
Matabele Mounted Police camp, and that eight of their
number had been murdered. Some twelve or fifteen of the
police promptly seized their rifles and bandoleers, and proceeded—on
their own accord—in skirmishing order to the
scene of the massacre, which they reached after a sharp twenty
minutes' walk. The enemy had disappeared from sight, but
the tale of those coolies who had been fortunate enough to
escape proved only too true. No less than eight coolies,
including one young woman, were found lying foully
murdered in different parts of the gardens, and every one,
though pierced through over and over again with assegai
stabs, was still warm. This proves that the enemy must have
rushed down on the unprotected coolies in broad daylight.</p>

<p class="i1">"Shortly after the return of the police to camp, a couple of
unarmed mounted men rode down to the gardens. They had
not been there five minutes when they were fired upon from
the adjacent kopjes, and they had to retire precipitately.
This goes to prove that the enemy do not intend to give up
their present position unless they are driven from it, and the
sooner that is effected the better." The following information
was also given to the public committee. Sedan deposed: "I
slept at my garden near the Butts last night with an American
negro called Smith. Smith this morning before sunrise
started to go to his own garden. I heard shots fired just
after he left me. His Zambesi boy ran over and told me
Smith had been killed. I saw about forty or fifty Kafirs. I
saw one man with a gun, whilst the rest had assegais and
sticks. I hid myself in a ditch, and saw the Kafirs in the
gardens. I saw them kill Indians with the gun and the
assegais. About half an hour later I saw a picket of four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
white men come to the gardens. I ran to the picket and
came in to town. I was too frightened to say anything."
Ahchelrising deposed: "I slept in my garden and heard a
shout from a lot of Indians early this morning that the
Matabele were on to us. I ran away, and saw my brother
Isree shot in front of me. I came to town and reported in
the laager, and then went back to my garden. I saw the
bodies of Goolab, Yitian, Venctayelee and his wife, Ramsamee
and Chinantoniem. Smith's Zambesi boy was also
killed."</p>

<p class="i1">On Tuesday night, 28th April, Earl Grey, accompanied by
his secretary Mr. Benson, and General Digby Willoughby—who
had been down to Mafeking in order to hurry forward
the food supplies and relief forces—arrived in Bulawayo.
The coach which brought the administrator and his party
was escorted into town by Lieutenant Parkin and his men,
whom I had met on their way down to meet it. They seem
to have narrowly missed, or been missed by, a portion of
Babian's impi, which was reported on Wednesday morning to
have crossed the road near the Khami river early on Tuesday
night just after the coach had passed.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning, Wednesday, 29th April, an
impi of several hundred Kafirs, in all likelihood a portion of
Babian's force, suddenly appeared on the rising ground about
1000 yards away from Dawson's Fort. They were probably
on their way to Wilson's homestead with the intention of
destroying and burning it down, but on seeing the fort
manned by a number of white men, were evidently a bit
taken aback, as they halted and held a council of war. They
then spread out in skirmishing order, and getting down
amongst the thorn trees in the river-bed below the house,
advanced towards the fort as if about to attack it. However,
after approaching to within 800 yards they thought better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of it and withdrew, probably imagining that the place was
defended with Maxim guns.</p>

<p class="i1">After retiring from the neighbourhood of the fort, they
went down to Captain Molyneux's farm, some two miles
distant, and destroyed and burnt everything they could, even
assegaiing the pigs, the carcasses of which animals they left
untouched, as the Matabele of Zulu descent do not eat the
flesh of the domestic pig, although they are very partial to
that of both species of the wild swine found in Southern
Africa, viz. the Wart Hog and the Bush Pig.</p>

<p class="i1">During my visit to Bulawayo it was at last decided to
build a fort at the Khami river, and I was asked to take the
work in hand forthwith. As only thirty men could be spared
from Bulawayo, it was arranged that twenty more should be
withdrawn from Fort Halsted, five miles beyond Fig Tree,
and I requested that Lieutenant Howard, an old member of
the Bechuanaland Border Police, who was at present with
Captain Molyneux at Fig Tree, and who had done very good
service in the first war during Major Forbes' memorable
retreat along the Tchangani river, should be placed in command
of the two troops combined.</p>

<p class="i1">On Friday, 1st May, I left Bulawayo with Lieutenant
Parkin and thirty men, accompanied by a mule waggon
carrying kit, tools for fort-building, and provisions. We had
first to take the waggon to Fort Marquand, there off-load it,
and then send it on to Fort Halsted to bring back the twenty
men from that place, who on their arrival at Mabukitwani
could be at once despatched, together with the thirty under
Lieutenant Parkin, to the Khami river, to commence building
the fort there. This was all arranged by the Sunday evening,
and everything got ready to proceed to the Khami river early
the following morning. That evening, my old friend Cornelius
Van Rooyen, commandant of the forces at Mangwe, accompanied 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by three of his men, arrived at my fort on his way to
see Earl Grey, by whom he had been called to Bulawayo.
He was, of course, an honoured guest with us, and we did all
we could to make him and his men comfortable.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time, Marzwe, Gambo's head Induna, was camped
with many of his people round the base of the hill on which
my fort stood. As he had often expressed a fear lest the
remainder of his people, who were living at their kraals some
eight miles to the west, should be attacked some fine morning
by Maiyaisa's impi, I had repeatedly told him to bring all his
women and children to the immediate vicinity of the fort,
since, as I had only ten serviceable horses at my disposal, it
was out of the question to attempt any attack on a large impi
in a thickly-wooded country, although I should be able to
protect any of his tribe who were willing to take quarters
round the walls of my fort.</p>

<p class="i1">On my last return from Bulawayo, I found that Marzwe
had taken my advice, and had sent messengers on the Saturday
morning to call all his people in to the fort. These men
ought to have returned with the women and children on the
following day, but owing to their dilatory ways, and their
unfailing habit of "never doing to-day what can be put off
till to-morrow," they did not do so.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning, Monday, 4th May, Lieutenants
Parkin and Webb started off early for the Khami river,
taking the mule waggon with them, Lieutenant Howard
and myself intending to follow them up and choose a site
for the fort immediately after breakfast. Just before
discussing this meal, Marzwe came out and reported to me
that one of his men had heard shots fired in the direction of
his kraal. None of my sentries or horse-guards having heard
these shots, I half thought there was no truth in the report.
However, I sent Mr. Simms and two other good men to scout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
round the back of some kopjes, about two miles to the west
of our position, beyond which the shots were said to have
been fired.</p>

<p class="i1">Shortly after the scouts had left, two of the men sent on
the previous Saturday to bring in the women and children
turned up, saying that Marzwe's town had been attacked at
daylight by a portion of Maiyaisa's impi, and some of his
people killed. A little later a young girl arrived at the
fort with an assegai-wound in her right side just above the
hip-bone. The wound was not a dangerous one, and after it
had been washed and dressed, the child was able to tell her
story, which was to the effect that Marzwe's kraal had been
surrounded in the night, and every man, woman, and child in
it murdered just at dawn.</p>

<p class="i1">Although, with the few mounted men at my disposal, I
knew it would be madness to engage any large number of
Matabele, unless I could get them in perfectly open country
where there was no chance of being surrounded, I was not
inclined to let this affair pass without endeavouring to
ascertain exactly what had happened. Van Rooyen at once
agreed to put off his visit to Bulawayo and accompany me
with his three troopers to the scene of the reported massacre,
and I sent a messenger to tell Lieutenant Parkin to return
immediately to Mabukitwani with ten good men mounted on
his best horses. When he arrived, my three scouts had also
returned, having seen nothing, and I found myself in command
of about twenty-five mounted men; some of the horses,
however, were in wretched condition, and altogether unfit
for hard work.</p>

<p class="i1">When the report of the massacre of his whole family, as
well as a large number of his people, was brought to Marzwe,
he received it with the utmost stoicism, only saying, "They
wanted me; they were looking for me; they wanted my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
skin." Whether he believed it or not I cannot say, but he
never betrayed the slightest sign of emotion.</p>

<p class="i1">It was already past mid-day when I was at last able to
get away with my little force, travelling across country under
the guidance of an elderly savage armed with a shield, and
two long-bladed insinuating-looking assegais, and at the same
time adorned with a chimney-pot hat, of all things in the
world, thus combining in his own person the attributes of
primitive savagery and the most advanced civilisation of
Western Europe.</p>

<p class="i1">Before we were a couple of miles from camp we met
a lot of women and children making for the fort, who
said that they had fled from some of Marzwe's outlying
villages early that morning as they had heard firing going
on in the direction of the chief's kraal. Soon after passing
these people we got into country where a small force such as
mine might have been very easily surrounded and cut up by
a hostile impi, as the ground was very broken and on every
side of us were small hills and rocky ridges, the whole being
covered with dense, scrubby bush, in many parts of which a
Kafir would have been invisible at a distance of thirty yards.
Had this sort of country continued for any great distance, I
would not have risked taking my men on indefinitely over
ground so very favourable to any force of hostile Matabele
which might chance to be there. However, after a time we
emerged into country of a more open character, where the
bush was much less dense, and where one was not constantly
shut in amongst kopjes and scrub-covered ridges.</p>

<p class="i1">Just here one of my flanking parties came on a woman
carrying a large bundle of blankets and other household
goods on her head. On being questioned, she told us that at
daylight that morning Marzwe's kraal had been attacked and
three of his men killed, as well as one girl who had endeavoured 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to escape with the rest of the men. The girl
referred to proved afterwards to be the damsel who had been
wounded in the side by an assegai, but who had managed to
evade her enemies and make her way to our fort at
Mabukitwani. All the rest of the women and children,
together with the cattle, sheep, and goats, the woman said,
had been captured by Maiyaisa's people, who, however, she
thought were in no great force, being only a small raiding
party detached from the main body at the Khami river.</p>

<p class="i1">But now comes the sequel, about which the wounded girl
had known nothing. Amongst Marzwe's men who had
escaped from the first onslaught on the kraal was one Obas.
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
This man had recognised that the attacking force was not a
large one, and he at once went round to all the outlying
villages and collected a very considerable number of his
chief's retainers, and taking command of them, followed up
the raiders, and not only rescued all the women and children
who had been taken captive but also killed eleven of the
enemy, and retook all the cattle, sheep, and goats they were
driving off. This good news was soon confirmed by Obas
himself, whom we met coming on with all the recaptured
women and children and cattle. He was a well-built, active-looking
Kafir of middle height, light in colour, and with good
features, altogether a good specimen of the best type of
Matabele. He was armed with a Martini-Henry rifle, as
were some few of his followers, whilst all carried assegais.
He told us much the same story as we had heard from the
woman who had just passed, except that he informed us
that the number of Marzwe's men who had been killed was
four, instead of three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">There was now no necessity to proceed any further, so we
turned back to the fort, where all Marzwe's people arrived
safely the same evening.</p>

<p class="i1">Early the following morning I rode over to the Khami
with Lieutenant Howard, and after selecting a site for the fort
which was to be built there, and leaving Lieutenant Howard
in charge, returned to Mabukitwani. Here I found a
telegram from Colonel Napier, which had been sent on to me by
Captain Molyneux from Fig Tree. It was to the effect that I
was to at once collect a force of forty mounted and eighty
dismounted men from all the forts along the road, including
Mangwe, and march them in to Bulawayo by Friday evening,
as they were required to form part of a column which was
to leave for the Tchangani on the following day, Saturday,
9th May.</p>

<p class="i1">As the time was so short, I rode the same evening
(Tuesday) to Fig Tree in order to despatch a telegram as
soon as possible to Major Armstrong, asking him to send me
up twenty mounted men from the garrisons of Matoli and
Mangwe, and on Wednesday I made all arrangements at the
other forts. As Colonel Napier particularly wished Captain
Molyneux and Lieutenant Howard to accompany the column, I
put Lieutenant Stewart in command at Fig Tree, whilst Lieutenant
Parkin took charge of the fort at the Khami river,
Lieutenant Grenfell taking over the command of my own fort.</p>

<p class="i1">On Thursday evening I had all the men from the lower
forts mustered at Mabukitwani, and after a cold rainy night
we marched to Bulawayo, picking up the other detachments
on our way, and reaching town before sundown on Friday
evening, 8th May.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Large column commanded by Colonel Napier despatched for the Tchangani to

reported to be at Thaba Induna—I am ordered to the front—Matabele
retire—Column in laager near Graham's store—Captain Grey's

<p><span class="sc">Owing</span> to various circumstances, it was found impossible to
get the column off for the Tchangani on the following
morning, and the start was not actually made until Monday,
11th May. This column, the largest yet sent out from Bulawayo,
was despatched with the object of opening the road to
the Tchangani river, where it was hoped that the relief force
from Salisbury under Colonel Beal, with which was Mr. Cecil
Rhodes, would be met, when the future movements of the
combined columns would be determined according to circumstances.</p>

<p class="i1">The composition of the force was as follows: Artillery,
four officers and thirty-four men under Captain Biscoe;
Grey's Scouts, four officers and forty men under Captain Grey;
Africander Corps, three officers and fifty-nine men under
Commandant Van Rensberg and Captain Van Niekerk; A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
troop (Gifford's Horse) two officers and nineteen men; B
troop (Gifford's Horse) two officers and twenty men—the
combined troops under Captain Fynn; F troop, one officer
and twenty men under Lieutenant H. Lamb; four officers
and 100 dismounted men under Captain Selous, consisting of
detachments from H, C, D, K, and L troops, under
Captains Mainwaring and Reid, and Lieutenants Holland
and Hyden; also four engineers; making altogether 312
Europeans, supported by 150 of Colenbrander's Colonial
Boys under Captain Windley, and 100 Friendly Matabele
under Chief Native Commissioner Taylor. Also one seven-pounder,
one 2·5 gun, one Hotchkiss, one Nordenfeldt, one
Maxim; fourteen mule waggons carrying provisions, kit, and
ammunition, and one ambulance waggon.</p>

<p class="i1">Of this force Colonel Napier was in command; Colonel
Spreckley, second in command; Captain Llewellyn, staff
orderly officer; Captain Howard Brown, staff officer; Captain
Bradley, remount officer; Captain Molyneux, adjutant;
Captain Wrey, heliograph officer; Captain Purssell, quartermaster;
Dr. Levy, medical officer, with Lieutenants Little,
Dollar, and Burnham as gallopers; whilst Captain the
Honourable C. J. White and Mr. A. Rhodes also accompanied
the expedition unattached, making I believe a total force of
forty-two officers and 613 men.</p>

<p class="i1">With the column was one of two colonial natives who
had been despatched on horseback a few days previously to
try and carry a message through to Gwelo. They saw no
signs of the enemy until after they had passed Mr. Stewart's
farm, but near the Tekwe river they rode into the middle
of a Matabele impi, in the middle of the night, which was
watching the road and had no fires burning. They were
immediately attacked, and the boy who got back to Bulawayo
had his horse killed under him almost immediately, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
received an assegai-wound in the arm. However, in the
darkness he managed to elude his enemies, and made his
way back to town. His companion neither reached Gwelo
nor ever returned to Bulawayo, but he apparently galloped
through his assailants at the Tekwe, only to be again waylaid,
and this time killed, at the Tchangani, where his corpse was
discovered a few days later lying in the road by Colonel
Beal's column.</p>

<p class="i1">To quote the words of the correspondent with the column
representing the <i>Bulawayo Chronicle</i>: "To the martial strains
of the town band, on Monday, 11th May, the column
under Colonel Napier left the citadel, and boldly started
forth into the country lately taken from us by the Matabele.
Within two hours our men had crossed from British
territory into the Matabele country—to wit, the Umguza
brooklet."</p>

<p class="i1">Arrived at the Umguza, it was found that we could not
proceed until certain stores, which had been left behind in
Bulawayo, reached us; and as these did not come to hand
until the following morning, we did not again make a move
until shortly before noon on Tuesday. For some miles our
route lay through perfectly open country, but on getting
abreast of Thaba Induna we came to a strip of thorn bush
through which the road passes. Here a halt was made, whilst
Colonel Spreckley went forward with Grey's Scouts to see if
the bush was clear of Kafirs. He soon sent a messenger
back reporting that the enemy were just in front of him, so
Colonel Napier asked me to go on and obtain further particulars
before he advanced with the whole column.</p>

<p class="i1">I found Colonel Spreckley about 600 yards in advance,
the bush between where he had halted his men and the main
body being much less dense than I had imagined, whilst in
front of him the country was very open indeed. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the grass was three or four feet high, and as some Kafirs had
been seen on the rise only a few hundred yards ahead, it was
impossible to tell how many of them there might be there.
Colonel Spreckley therefore wanted some men on foot to be
sent forward to assist the Scouts in driving the Kafirs out of
the long grass.</p>

<p class="i1">I at once galloped back to the column, and was ordered
to go forward again with two of the three troops of infantry
under my command, Colonel Napier bringing on the remainder
of the force behind us. As soon as my footmen reached the
advance guard, we all spread out in skirmishing order and
went forwards as rapidly as possible. The Kafirs, however,
who had been seen in the long grass could only have been
a few scouts, who, on seeing the mounted men, had retired on
the main body, for until we came within a mile of the little
pyramidal hill which stands by itself about a mile to the
south of the low flat-topped hill known as Thaba Induna,
we never saw a sign of the enemy.</p>

<p class="i1">Then, however, standing as we were on the crest of a rise,
from which the ground sloped off into a broad valley which
lay between us and the aforesaid hill, we suddenly came in
sight of a considerable number of the rebels. A detachment
of them was on the hill itself, whilst considerable numbers
were scattered over the open ground below it. Altogether
some hundreds of them must have been in sight. Between
the single hill and the wooded slopes of Thaba Induna itself
there is a space of perfectly open ground over a mile in
breadth, and it certainly looked to the eye of an old hunter,
accustomed in the pursuit of game to measure distances and
take in at a glance the details of the ground before him, that,
had the whole of the mounted men with the column at this
juncture galloped as hard as they could go to the point of
Thaba Induna, and then swept round at the back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
single hill, a large number of the rebels would have been cut
off from the bush and killed in the open ground.</p>

<p class="i1">These tactics, however, were not adopted, and the natives
got off scot free, for although a few shots were fired at them
with a Maxim and seven-pounder at an unknown range, none
were hit, and they all retreated into the thick bush to the
north of Thaba Induna. Our column then advanced for
another couple of miles, and laagered up near Graham's store
on the Kotki river.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">On the following day the column remained in laager, and
Colonel Napier took out a patrol, consisting of some 150
mounted men of Grey's Scouts, Gifford's Horse, and the
Africander Corps, to ascertain if any of the rebels were still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in our vicinity, and Captain Wrey accompanied the patrol in
order to send some heliographic messages to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">Leaving the laager about 8 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, this force first returned
about three miles along the road to Bulawayo, and when
abreast of the single hill I have spoken of as having been
occupied by the rebels on the previous day, turned to the
right, and spreading out in skirmishing order advanced
towards the hill, which was reached without a Kafir having
been seen. Here Captain Wrey was left with his heliograph
party, and a further advance was made towards the bush on
the north-east corner of Thaba Induna, where were found the
"scherms," or military camps of the Matabele who had been
seen on the previous day. These encampments appeared to
have been evacuated early that morning, their occupants
having probably moved off to join the impis which had
retired from the vicinity of Bulawayo a short time before
and taken up their quarters on the lower Umguza.</p>

<p class="i1">After these scherms had been burnt, a portion of the
patrol was detached to the right, consisting of Grey's Scouts,
a section of the Africander Corps, and a small party of
Gifford's Horse, in all about eighty men. This detachment,
after having advanced for a couple of miles through undulating
country more or less covered with thorn bush, which in
some places was fairly thick, came suddenly upon a small
impi of 200 or 300 Kafirs, which I believe was a section of
the Ingubu regiment.</p>

<p class="i1">These men had taken up a position along the crest of a
rough stony ridge covered with bush, and when the approaching
horsemen were still some four hundred yards distant they
opened fire on them. Captain Grey immediately ordered his
men to charge, which they did in extended order.</p>

<p class="i1">The sight of the long line of cavalry thundering down
upon them seems to have turned the hearts of the savages to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
water, as their saying is, for after having fired a few more
shots, they turned and ran, trusting to evade their enemies
in the bush. A considerable number of them no doubt
succeeded in doing so, but the chase was continued for a mile
and a half, and when it was at last abandoned a long line of
corpses marked the track where the whirlwind of the white
man's vengeance had swept along. <i>Vae victis!</i>—"woe to the
conquered!"—woe indeed; for amongst the men who took part
in the pursuit of the Kafirs, on this, to them, most fatal day,
were many who, maddened by the loss of old chums foully
slain in cold blood by the natives, were determined to use
their opportunity to the utmost to inflict a heavy punishment
for the crimes committed, while all were bent on exacting
vengeance for the murders of the European women and
children who had been hurried out of existence during the
first days of the rebellion. Once broken, the Kafirs never
made any attempt to rally, but ran as hard as they could,
accepting death when overtaken without offering the slightest
resistance; some indeed, when too tired to run any farther,
walked doggedly forward with arms in their hands which
they never attempted to use, and did not even turn their
heads to look at the white men who were about to shoot them
down. No quarter was either given or asked for, nor was any
more mercy shown than had been lately granted by the Kafirs
to the white women and children who had fallen into their
power. This realistic picture may seem very horrible to all
those who believe themselves to be superior beings to the
cruel colonists of Rhodesia, but let them not forget the terrible
provocation. I cannot dispute the horror of the picture; but
I must confess that had I been with Captain Grey that day,
I should have done my utmost to kill as many Kafirs as
possible, and yet I think I can claim to be as humane a man
as any of my critics who may feel inclined to consider such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
deeds cowardly and brutal and altogether unworthy of a
civilised being.</p>

<p class="i1">This claim to humanity, coupled with the defence of savage
deeds, may seem paradoxical, but the fact is, as I have said
before, that in the smooth and easy course of ordinary civilised
existence it is possible for a man to live a long life without
ever becoming aware that somewhere deep down below the
polished surface of conventionality there exists in him an
ineradicable leaven of innate ferocity, which, although it may
never show itself except under the most exceptional circumstances,
must and ever will be there—the cruel instinct
which, given sufficient provocation, prompts the meekest
nature to kill his enemy—the instinct which forms the
connecting link between the nature of man and that of the
beast.</p>

<p class="i1">The horrors of a native insurrection—the murders and
mutilations of white men, women, and children by savages—are
perhaps better calculated than anything else to awake
this slumbering fiend—the indestructible and imperishable
inheritance which, through countless generations, has been
handed down to the most highly civilised races of the present
day from the savage animals or beings from whom or which
modern science teaches us that they have been evolved. I
have been told that Mr. Labouchere often jokingly says that
we are all monkeys with our tails rubbed off, but with natures
still very much akin to those of our simian relatives; and
however that may be, we are certainly the descendants of the
fierce and savage races by whom Northern and Central Europe
was peopled in prehistoric times; and I am afraid that the
saying of Napoleon, that "if you scratch a Russian you will
find a Tartar," may be extended to embrace the modern Briton
or any other civilised people of Western Europe, none of whom
it will be found necessary to scratch very deeply in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
to discover the savage ancestors from whom they are
descended.</p>

<p class="i1">On Wednesday afternoon subsequent to the dispersal of
the natives, several kraals were burnt and a good deal of corn
taken, which proved most valuable, being urgently required to
keep the horses and mules in condition. About eighty head of
cattle and some sheep and goats were also captured by Captain
Fynn and Lieutenant Moffat. As during the time when the
Kafirs were being chased by Grey's Scouts and the Africanders,
Captain Wrey had received a heliographic message from Earl
Grey, requesting Colonel Napier not to proceed any farther
until some waggons loaded with provisions for the Salisbury
column, which had already left Bulawayo, had reached him, we
spent another day in laager. The weather had now turned very
cold, and on the Wednesday night heavy storms of rain had
fallen all round us, though we had escaped with only a few
drops; but on the following night, or rather very early on
Friday morning, a soaking shower passed over us, and as we
were lying out in the open, our blankets got wet through,
rendering a very early start impossible; although, the convoy
having reached us on Thursday night, the order had been
given to have everything packed up ready to move by
daylight.</p>

<p class="i1">However we got off by eight o'clock, and reached Lee's store,
distant twenty-four miles from Bulawayo, before mid-day. This
store and hotel, noted as being the most comfortable on the
whole road between the capital of Matabeleland and Salisbury,
had, like every other building erected by a white man in this
part of the country, been burnt down and as far as possible
destroyed. After our horses and transport animals had had
a couple of hours' feeding, we proceeded on our way, and
laagered up for the night on the site of the camp where Dr.
Jameson was attacked on 1st November 1893 by the Imbezu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and Ingubu regiments, during his memorable march from
Mashunaland to Bulawayo.</p>

<p class="i1">On every side of this camp but that facing towards the
west, the country consisted of open rolling downs, entirely
devoid of bush for miles and miles. On the western face
there was a space of open ground bounded at a distance of
500 or 600 yards by a strip of open thorn bush, and it was
through this thorn bush that the Matabele warriors made
their advance. Naturally, as they had to face the fire of
several Maxims and other pieces of ordnance, they never got
beyond the edge of the bush. It seems a marvel that they
should have been foolish enough to advance as they did,
but it was doubtless their ignorance of the impossibility
of taking a laager by assault in the face even of a heavy rifle
fire, let alone Maxim guns and other destructive toys of a
similar character, which led them to expose themselves so
vainly. But they learnt a lesson that day which has never
been forgotten in Matabeleland, as the present campaign has
shown.</p>

<p class="i1">The three following days were entirely without incident,
as we never saw a sign of a Kafir, though every wayside
hotel and store had been burnt to the ground. On Monday
evening we laagered up at a spot a few miles short of the
Pongo store, where it was known that some white men had
been murdered. Mr. Burnham, the American scout, who had
ridden on ahead in the afternoon, returned to the column at
dusk from the store, with the news that a scouting party
from the Salisbury contingent had been there also the same
day, but had returned towards the Tchangani just before his
own arrival.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning, Tuesday, 19th May, we reached
the Pongo store early, having passed the coach which had
been captured by the Kafirs some three miles on this side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
it. As I have already stated, one wheel had been removed
from the coach, and the pole had been sawn in two, whilst
the contents of the mail-bags had been torn up and strewn
over the ground in every direction. The sun-dried carcasses
of the mules still lay all of a heap in their harness, just as
they had fallen when they were assegaied some six weeks
previously.</p>

<p class="i1">On reaching the store we found and buried the bodies of
the two poor fellows (Hurlstone and Reddington) who had
been murdered there just seven weeks previously, on Tuesday,
24th March. Both their skulls had been battered and chipped
by heavy blows struck with knob-kerries and axes. The
bodies had not been touched by any animal or Kafir since
the day when the murders were committed, as their clothes
and boots had not been removed, and the blankets thrown
over them by the patrol party sent out from the Tchangani,
two days after they were killed, were still covering them.
The poor battered remains of what had so lately been two
fine young Englishmen were reverently placed by their
countrymen in a hastily-dug grave, and a prayer said over
them by the good Catholic priest Father Barthélemy. The
remains of the third white man murdered here were found
at some little distance from the store.</p>

<p class="chapsum">Meet Salisbury relief force, with Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Sir Charles Metcalfe, and

kraals burnt—Scouting party sent out under Captain Van Niekerk—Band
of cattle captured—Large body of Kafirs met with—A running

joins us with Colonial Boys—Advance and take part in the fight—Enemy's

<p><span class="sc">On</span> resuming our journey, we had not proceeded a couple of
miles, when on cresting a rise we came in sight of the Salisbury
relief force coming out of the bush ahead of us and just
entering the valley which lay between us. The two columns
were soon laagered up in the open ground some 500 yards
apart on either side of a small stream. With the Salisbury
contingent were Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Sir Charles Metcalfe, and
several gentlemen who, having left Bulawayo on a shooting
trip some two months previously, had been obliged on the
outbreak of the rebellion to take refuge in the Gwelo laager,
where they had been cooped up ever since.</p>

<p class="i1">Mr. Rhodes, I thought, looked remarkably well, and yet
the fast grizzling hair and a certain look in the strong face
told the tale of the excessive mental strain undergone during
the last few months. Amongst those who had joined the
Salisbury column at Gwelo were Mr. Weston Jarvis, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Farquhar, the Hon. Tatton Egerton (M.P. for Knutsford) and
his son. That evening Mr. Rhodes and Colonel Napier dined
with our mess, and in course of conversation after dinner it
was decided that, instead of returning at once with the combined
columns along the main road to Bulawayo, a flying
column should be sent under Colonel Spreckley through the
country to the south of the hills bordering the Insiza river,
whilst Colonel Napier should travel down the valley of that
river itself with the main body; the two columns to meet
in the neighbourhood of the ford across the Insiza, on the
road from Bulawayo to Belingwe.</p>

<p class="i1">Early on the morning of Thursday, 21st May, Colonel
Spreckley's column of about four hundred men left us
and bore away to the south; the main body to which
my own troop was attached making a move very
shortly afterwards. We first kept the road as far as the
valley beyond the Pongo store, but there turned off to the
south, outspanning at about eleven o'clock amongst a lot of
kraals, all of which had evidently been hastily vacated on
our approach, as they were all full of grain, and pots were
found cooking on fires that had only lately been lighted.
The corn-bins in these villages were one and all quite full of
maize, Kafir corn, and ground-nuts, showing not only that the
harvest in this part of Matabeleland had been a very plentiful
one, but also that the people thought they had got rid of the
white men for good and all and had no reason to fear their return.</p>

<p class="i1">After all the grain had been removed that we could
carry, the kraals were burnt and the remainder of the corn
destroyed, in order that it might not again fall into the hands
of the rebels, for a good food-supply constitutes "the sinews
of war" to a savage people, who are not likely to come to
terms as long as such supplies hold out.</p>

<p class="i1">In the afternoon we moved on a few miles farther, destroying 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
several more kraals. The huts in some of these had been
newly built and plastered, and we found that ground had
been freshly hoed up to lie fallow until the sowing-time
came. In every village were found goods of some kind or
another which had belonged to the many white people
murdered in this district, and the articles of women's clothing,
and especially a hat that was recognised as having
belonged to a young girl of the name of Agnes Kirk,
made the troopers simply mad to exact vengeance on the
murderers.</p>

<p class="i1">About two miles distant from the spot where we laagered
up for the night, the huts of some white prospectors were
found, but no trace of their former owners. These huts had
been made use of by the Kafirs as store-rooms, and were
found to be full of every conceivable description of merchandise,
taken from neighbouring farmhouses and the
hotels and stores along the road. The goods were all
carefully packed up, and included bags of sugar, flour, and
Boer meal, as well as boxes of soap and candles, tinned
provisions, blankets, and many other articles. Outside the
huts stood a waggon and a coach, the latter of which was
known to have been brought from the Tekwe store, some five
miles distant.</p>

<p class="i1">As it was evident that we were now in the midst of a
native population, who were not only responsible for the
murders of the white men in the district, the destruction of
their homes, and the looting of their property, but who also
seemed so infatuated by their success that they appeared to
think that the compatriots of the murdered people "would
never come back no more," it was determined to make an
effort to prove to them in a practical manner that there is
some truth in the French proverb which says that "tout
vient à qui sait attendre."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Therefore at 4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on the following morning, the 22nd
May, Grey's Scouts and a portion of the Africander Corps
under Captain Van Niekerk, in all about one hundred men,
were sent out down the valley of the Insiza in order to try
and discover the whereabouts of the main body of the rebels
in this part of the country. The members of the patrol at
first proceeded on foot, leading their horses until day broke,
when the order was given to mount. Shortly afterwards
smoke was seen rising from a valley amongst the hills to the
left, and the horses' heads were at once turned in that
direction, and presently, after the first range of hills which
bounds the Insiza valley had been passed, a herd of cattle
was seen amongst the broken country on ahead. These
cattle were found to be in charge of a small force of Kafirs,
who abandoned them to the white men without making much
resistance.</p>

<p class="i1">It was the firing which took place during this skirmish
which was heard in camp soon after sunrise, and which
caused Colonel Napier to send Commandant Van Rensberg
and myself with a small party to ascertain what was going
on. Just after these cattle had been captured, Mr. Little and
some of Gifford's Horse under Captain Fynn, forming the
right-hand flanking party to Colonel Spreckley's column, which
was then moving forwards some four miles to the south, rode
up, having been attracted by the firing. After a few minutes'
conversation, no more Kafirs being anywhere in sight, Colonel
Spreckley's men went on their way, whilst the Scouts and
Africanders started on their return with the captured cattle
towards the laager. A little farther on a halt was made, and
some of the men produced some provisions from their wallets
and were proceeding to discuss the same, when Kafirs were
suddenly seen on the crest of a rise in front.</p>

<p class="i1">At this moment Captain Grey was missing, but he turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
up immediately afterwards with seven of the Scouts, who
had been foraging with him, each man having a dead sheep
tied behind his saddle. These, however, had to be immediately
cut loose and abandoned, as large numbers of Kafirs were now
seen both in front and to the right, where they had previously
been hidden in a deep river-bed.</p>

<p class="i1">A running fight was now commenced, which was
kept up for some four miles before the Kafirs were shaken
off. When it was first seen that the Matabele were
in force, and meant to try and cut off their enemy's
retreat, Captain Grey sent the American Scout Burnham,
together with a compatriot named Blick, to the top of
a hill on ahead, to try and ascertain the numbers and
disposition of the rebels; but Burnham and his companion
were cut off from the main body, and had to gallop for their
lives, and had they not both been very well mounted, they
would probably not have got away, as the Kafirs nearly
surrounded them in a very rocky bit of ground. The cattle
which had been captured had to be abandoned by the men
who were driving them, and very hurriedly too, as a party of
the rebels made a determined attempt to cut them off from
the main body.</p>

<p class="i1">Early in the fight Trooper Rothman of the Africanders
was shot through the stomach, and, as a comrade named
Parker belonging to the same corps was assisting the
wounded man to mount his horse, he was himself shot
through the upper part of the body, from side to side, and
died almost immediately. Poor Parker had to be left where
he fell, as there was no means of carrying him.</p>

<p class="i1">Just as the white men were descending the last hill-slope
into the level valley of the Insiza river, a young Dutchman
named Frikky Greeff, the son of an old elephant-hunter
long resident in Matabeleland, had his horse shot through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
both forelegs just above the fetlocks. On being struck the
poor animal fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground. He,
however, soon extricated himself, and one of the Scouts,
Trooper Button, who was riding a strong, quiet horse, took
him up behind him. Up to this time poor Rothman had
been able to retain his seat on his horse, but being greatly
weakened by loss of blood, and in fact in a dying condition,
he now fell off. Lieutenant Sinclair of the Africander Corps,
on seeing this, dismounted, and with the assistance of others
placed Rothman across his saddle, and, mounting behind
him, carried him in this way for over three miles. By this
time it was apparent to all that the man was dead, so, as the
Kafirs had now given up the pursuit, the body was placed
on the ground in a shady place, there to remain until it could
be recovered and brought in to camp.</p>

<p class="i1">After getting out into the open country the horses were
off-saddled for an hour on the banks of a stream which runs
into the Insiza, and the patrol then returned to laager.
Besides the two men who were killed, two more were
wounded, though not seriously, Trooper Niemand being shot
through the fleshy part of the arm, and Trooper Geldenhuis
getting something more than a graze just above his ankle.
Singularly enough, as all the men were mixed up together, all
the casualties occurred to members of the Africander Corps.</p>

<p class="i1">Just at sunrise the same morning Colonel Napier asked
me to take a few mounted men of the Salisbury column and
proceed, together with a small detachment of the Africander
Corps under Commandant Van Rensberg, to a ridge of hills
on our left rear, in order to burn some kraals which could be
seen with the glasses in that direction.</p>

<p class="i1">We were just getting ready to start, when shots were
heard straight ahead of us down the Insiza valley; and as the
firing, though never very heavy, was kept up until our horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
were all saddled up, Van Rensberg and myself asked permission
to take our men in the direction of the firing, as we
knew that it meant that Captains Grey and Van Niekerk were
engaged with a party of Matabele, and we thought that we
might be able to render them some assistance.</p>

<p class="i1">Colonel Napier at once granted us permission to do as we
wished; so we lost no time in making a move, and before we
had ridden much more than a mile heard two shots at no
great distance on our left front. We immediately turned in
that direction, and after having crossed a small stream, again
heard two more shots which sounded quite close, in fact, only
just beyond a ridge of low stony hills on our left. On hearing
these shots we rode to the crest of the ridge as quickly as
possible, and then saw a broad open valley beyond us, in the
centre of which stood a good-sized native kraal. We however
could see nothing, either of our friends or our enemies, nor
did we hear any further shots. We therefore crossed the
ridge, and a deep river-bed beyond it, and rode towards the
kraal, with the intention of burning it. Before reaching it,
however, we caught sight of a few natives running through
some corn stubble, and galloping after them found them to be a
young woman and three little girls. These were taken prisoners
and sent back to camp, as it was thought that Colonel
Napier might be able to obtain some information from them
regarding the whereabouts of any impis that might be about.</p>

<p class="i1">Just then a man carrying a shield and assegais was seen
running to our right. He was soon caught and shot by some
of the Africanders, just as he threw himself under a bush,
where he then lay on his face, dead. "Pull him out that I
may look on the murderer's face," I said in Dutch to the
men, which they did, revealing the features of a middle-aged
evil-looking Kafir, whom, however, I did not remember to
have ever seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">After killing this man we rode back towards the kraal,
but before reaching it, made out a number of Matabele
standing on the slope of a hill overlooking a deep river-bed,
about a mile distant. On looking at these natives through
the glasses, I could see that they were all men, many
carrying shields, and as there were too many of them to
make it possible to suppose that they all belonged to the
kraal near which we were standing, I surmised that they
probably belonged to the impi with which Captains Grey
and Van Niekerk had been engaged.</p>

<p class="i1">Not knowing their numbers, and recognising the impossibility
of getting at them in the hills with mounted men,
Van Rensberg and myself judged it advisable to send back to
the laager for a reinforcement of men on foot. A man was
therefore at once despatched with a verbal message to Colonel
Napier, and whilst waiting for his return we took up our
position on the crest of the rise we had previously crossed, in
order both to guard against a surprise and keep a watch on
the enemy. These latter gradually retired round the shoulder
of the hill and disappeared from view.</p>

<p class="i1">From where we had taken up our position we could see
the laager, which was little more than a mile distant, and the
reinforcement of footmen we had asked for had already left it,
when a heavy fusillade broke out which sounded amongst the
hills to our left front. Immediately after this heavy firing
commenced, large numbers of Matabele, who up to that moment
had been hidden in the river-bed below the hill on which we
had seen the others standing, suddenly showed themselves, and
streamed out across a corn-field with the evident intention of
taking part in the fight which it seemed was going on between
the Scouts and Africanders under Captains Grey and Van
Niekerk and another body of Matabele. Our party consisted of
only twenty-two men all told, and it was rather difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
know what was the best course for us to pursue; but we had just
decided to go on and try and reach our friends without waiting
for the reinforcements, when the heavy firing ceased, being
succeeded by scattered shots, which showed that the fight was
moving more and more to the right. The Matabele whom we
had seen leaving the shelter of the river-bed must also have
recognised this fact, as they soon returned, marching in lines
across the corn-field where we had first seen them, and again
taking up their old position.</p>

<p class="i1">Shortly after this Captain Windley and Lieutenant Frost
came up with thirty Colonial Boys, and Captain Taylor and
Lieutenant Jackson also brought a contingent of Friendly
Matabele; but as but few of these latter were armed with
rifles, they could not be expected to be very useful in attacking
a position, though no doubt they would have done
excellent service in following up a defeated foe. Mr. Cecil
Rhodes, Sir Charles Metcalfe, Mr. Weston Jarvis, and
Lieutenant Howard also came up with the Colonial Boys.</p>

<p class="i1">On their arrival we at once proceeded as quickly as
possible towards the point in the hills from which the heavy
firing had seemed to come, and after having advanced for
about a mile and a half through thick thorn bush we found
ourselves in a valley bounded on one side by the main range
of hills, and on the other by a single hill very thickly wooded
at the crest. At this point several natives were seen on
the hills above us to the left, and a few shots were fired at
them, which they returned, whilst at the same time some
shots were also fired at us from the crest of the rise to our
right. I therefore ordered the Colonial Boys to charge up the
hill and take it, which they at once did, led by their officers
and Lieutenant Howard; the few natives who had been
firing from the summit at once giving up their position, and
running down into the thick bush on the farther side, several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of them leaving blankets and other goods behind them, whilst
in one case a handkerchief had been abandoned, which was
found to contain about twenty Martini-Henry cartridges.
After we had taken possession of the hill, a few odd Matabele
fired a shot or two at us from the valley below and from the
hills above, but their fire was soon silenced by the heavy
fusillade kept up by the Colonial Boys.</p>

<p class="i1">From the position we had taken we commanded a good
view over the country to our front and right front, but we
could see nothing of the mounted men under Captains Grey
and Van Niekerk, and therefore judged that they had found
it necessary to retreat from the Matabele by a circuitous
route to the laager; and we soon saw that it would be expedient
for us to do the same, as we could see a large number
of rebels on a hill about 1000 yards to our right, amongst
them being a man on horseback, and knew that besides
those actually in sight there were many others in the river-bed
under the hill, as well as the impi which had been
engaged with the Scouts and Africanders, which we afterwards
discovered was lying in a deep river-bed hidden from
view only a short distance ahead of the hill on which we
were standing.</p>

<p class="i1">In the valley beyond this river-bed were two small herds
of cattle in a corn-field, but this seemed such a very obvious
bait to entice us onwards that Van Rensberg and myself at
once saw the advisability of getting back to the more open
country beyond the thick thorn bush through which we had
come as quickly as possible, in order not to allow ourselves to
be outflanked by the impi to our right, which had now disappeared
in the bush behind the hill on which we had
seen it.</p>

<p class="i1">Had we crossed the river-bed in front of us and endeavoured
to capture the cattle, we should have been completely 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cut off from the laager by two separate impis, which
our small force would have been altogether inadequate to
cope with. By keeping well to the right, however, on our
return to the open country we avoided coming in contact
with the enemy in the bush, and saw nothing more of them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> reaching the laager, Van Rensberg and myself, backed by
Mr. Cecil Rhodes, were very anxious to have the base camp
moved at once to the kraal near to which we had captured
the woman in the early morning, and then at once attack the
impis we had seen that same afternoon with as large a force
as could be spared from the laager. However, as Captains
Grey and Van Niekerk had then not yet returned, Colonel
Napier thought it would be better to move the laager round
the hills to the vicinity of the Insiza river and attack the
rebels from that side on the following day.</p>

<p class="i1">This plan was at once acted upon, and the Scouts and
Africanders turning up just as we had inspanned, we moved
round the broken country in which the Matabele had taken
up their positions, and camped in open ground beyond it, on
a small stream running into the Insiza river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">Early the following morning we moved to the bank of the
river itself, just opposite the spot where a Dutchman named
Fourie had been building a house for a Mr. Ross, whose
temporary residence whilst the house was being built could
be seen still standing on a rise some mile and a half farther
down the river.</p>

<p class="i1">At the latter end of March Mr. Fourie had been living
here with his wife and six children, whilst Mr. and Mrs. Ross
with an adopted daughter named Agnes Kirk were occupying
temporary dwellings some little distance away from them.
These eleven people—two men and nine women and children—were
all murdered on the outbreak of the rebellion, Miss
Johanna Ross being the only survivor of her family, and
owing her escape to the fact that at the time the murders
were committed she was on a visit to friends living near
the main road, who, having received warning of the rising,
took her with them to Mr. Stewart's store at the Tekwe river,
where they were relieved by Captain Grey and his men on
Thursday, 26th March.</p>

<p class="i1">With others I went down to the scene of the massacre of
the Fourie family early in the morning and found the remains
of four people—a woman and three children, the body
of Mr. Fourie and those of three of the children being
missing. The murders had evidently been committed with
knob-kerries and axes, as the skulls of all these poor people
had been very much shattered. The remains had been much
pulled about by dogs or jackals, but the long fair hair of the
young Dutch girls was still intact, and it is needless to say
that these blood-stained tresses awoke the most bitter wrath
in the hearts of all who looked upon them, Englishmen and
Dutchmen alike vowing a pitiless vengeance against the
whole Matabele race.</p>

<p class="i1">At about ten o'clock a force of about 300 men under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Captain Grey was despatched to the scene of yesterday's
fighting, Colonel Napier and staff taking up a position with
a seven-pounder gun on the top of a hill which commanded
the valley in which we had seen the two small herds of cattle
on the preceding day. I was placed in charge of the infantry
division, which, spread out in skirmishing order, formed the
centre of the line of attack.</p>

<p class="i1">After what had been seen that morning of the ghastly
remains of the Fourie family, every one was most eager to
come to close quarters with the Kafirs, but we were not
able to do so, as, although we found the scherms where they
had slept, with the fires still burning in them, the impis had
left apparently at daylight in the morning, and it was impossible
to tell in which direction they had gone, as their
camp was surrounded by rough stony hills, on which their
footsteps had left no trace. As the number of their scherms
showed that the rebels must have been at least a thousand
strong, I don't quite know why they did not wait for us and
have another day's fighting, the more especially as they had
been successful in repulsing about one hundred mounted men
of the Scouts and Africanders on the previous day. I am
half inclined to think that several rocket signals sent up
from our laager during the early part of the preceding night,
to notify our whereabouts to Colonel Spreckley, may have
had something to do with their unexpected retreat, or possibly
a peep at our laager at daylight may have given them an
exaggerated idea of our numbers. At any rate they were
gone, and the blow which might have been struck at them
on the afternoon of the day before was now not struck at all.</p>

<p class="i1">On the site of the engagement of the previous morning
between Grey's Scouts and the Africanders and the one
section of the Matabele, we found the body of Parker,
absolutely stripped of clothing, even to the socks, and riddled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
with assegai stabs inflicted after death. The corpse was
carried back to camp, together with that of Rothman, which
latter, as it had been carried to some distance from the scene
of the fight, had not been found and mutilated by the Kafirs.
The Matabele must have removed their dead, as none were
lying on the hill-side below Parker's corpse, where many had
been seen to fall. However, in a small kraal situated just
under the hills and within a mile of the scene of the fight,
we found a Kafir lying stretched out on his back close to the
door of a hut, who could not long have been dead, as his
body was still warm, and his limbs quite limp. He had
evidently been wounded during the fight, the bullet having
passed through both thighs, and broken the right femur.
Then I suppose he had been carried or had crawled to the
village where we found him lying, and a cord tightly twisted
round his neck showed that he had been strangled shortly
before our arrival on the scene. Whether he had thus compassed
his own death on hearing or being informed of our
approach, or whether he had been strangled by a friend to
prevent his falling into the hands of the white men, I cannot
say, but as, besides having been strangled, he had a fresh
assegai-wound in the right side, I fancy that he had been
killed by his friends, who had fled at our approach and were
unable to carry the wounded man with them.</p>

<p class="i1">Besides this man, another was found in a dying condition—a
young fellow of two or three and twenty who must
have been some one of importance, as his friends had made a
stretcher of oxhide lashed to poles, on which to carry him.
They seem to have been surprised in the act of carrying him
away, as the stretcher was first found, and then the wounded
man was seen crawling away at a little distance, but he was
nearly spent, having been shot right through the chest, and
died soon afterwards. His shield and assegais, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
little personal belongings, were found tied on to the
stretcher.</p>

<p class="i1">After having burnt a few kraals and picked up a flock
of sheep and goats and a stray cow or two, we returned to
laager very much disappointed that we had had a ten-mile
walk for nothing, so far as meeting with the rebels was
concerned. The Hon. Tatton Egerton (M.P. for Knutsford)
accompanied us on this outing, walking and shouldering a
rifle with the rest of us, and unless I am very much mistaken
no one was more eager to let off his piece at a Kafir
than was he. In the afternoon a military funeral was
accorded to the bodies of Parker and Rothman, and also to
the poor scattered remains of the Fourie family, which having
been carefully collected were all buried in one grave dug
close alongside that in which the two dead troopers had been
placed. The funeral service was read by the Rev. Douglas
Pelly, who was attached to the Salisbury contingent.</p>

<p class="i1">After the service was over I took a few men of the
Africander Corps, and some friendly Matabele with a stretcher,
and went off to collect the remains of the Ross family. These
we found had been scattered and dragged about in every
direction by dogs or wild animals. We could find no trace
of Mr. Ross, and it is quite possible that he had been
murdered at some distance from his homestead. The broken
skull of a young woman which we found close to the door of
one of the huts must have been that of Miss Agnes Kirk,
but of old Mrs. Ross all we found by which to identify her
was a mass of long grey hair, the skull having disappeared.
Besides these sad relics we also found the remains of three
children, the one a boy by his clothes, and the other two,
little girls, their fair hair being still plaited into several short
plaits in the Boer style. These three poor children must
have been members of the Fourie family who had probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
been visiting the Rosses on the day when the murders were
committed.</p>

<p class="i1">Thus, of the eleven people murdered here some remains
of all were found, except of Mr. Fourie and Mr. Ross, and
these being the only men were very likely led away on some
pretext, such as looking at cattle, and murdered at a distance
from their dwellings where there was no chance of their
getting hold of rifles or revolvers. Then, the men being disposed
of, the noble savages came down fearlessly to the
homesteads and smashed in the heads of the women and
children comfortably and at their leisure.</p>

<p class="i1">On Sunday, 24th May—the Queen's Birthday—we continued
our march down the Insiza valley, burning a large
number of kraals as we advanced. All these kraals had only
just been deserted by their owners, and they were all full of
grain, while, in addition, in every one were found articles of
some kind or another which had been taken from the homesteads
of white men. All the grain that could not be carried
with us was destroyed as far as possible. In many of the
kraals were found large accumulations of dried meat, and
many dried skins of bullocks, cows and calves, proving that
the rinderpest had been brought into this district by the
natives since the outbreak of the rebellion, and had been
playing havoc amongst their cattle.</p>

<p class="i1">As we advanced, burning kraal after kraal, on the northern
slope of the range which runs to the south of and parallel to
the course of the Insiza river, column after column of smoke
continually ascending into the clear sky from the southern
side of the hills let us know that Colonel Spreckley's column
was devastating the murderers' country on his line of march
as effectually as we were doing on ours.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following day we still pursued our way unopposed
down the Insiza valley, burning kraal after kraal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
but never seeing a sign of the native inhabitants, who had
evidently received timely notice of our approach and fled
into the hills. On the morning of Wednesday, 27th May, we
reached the Belingwe road at about nine o'clock, and were soon
joined by Colonel Spreckley's column which had been waiting
for us a little farther down the road. Colonel Spreckley's
force had had no general engagement with the enemy, but
his scouts had captured about seven hundred head of cattle
and twenty-three donkeys. They had also found the remains
of several murdered Europeans, amongst whom the bodies of
a miner named Gracey and those of Dr. and Mrs. Langford
and a Mr. Lemon were recognised. Mr. Gracey's body lay
just outside his hut, but he had evidently been killed when
lying on his bed inside, as a blanket still lying there was
soaked through and through with blood.</p>

<p class="i1">The case of Dr. and Mrs. Langford is one of the saddest
of the many sad episodes of the late native insurrection in
Matabeleland. They had been married but a short time, and
had only left the old country three months before the rebellion
broke out. Unfortunately fate ordained that they
should reach Bulawayo, and leave it in order to take up their
residence in the Insiza district, just before the outbreak.
Thus they were suddenly surprised by a party of murderous
savages when travelling in their waggon. Mr. Lemon was
with them, and his body was found lying close to that of Dr.
Langford; but poor Mrs. Langford's corpse was discovered
some two miles away under the bank of a stream flowing a few
hundred yards below Mr. Rixon's farmstead. It looked as if
when first attacked the two men had held the murderers at
bay, and given Mrs. Langford time to run on to Mr. Rixon's
house in the hope of obtaining assistance. But when she
reached the homestead she found it unoccupied, Mr. Rixon
having left the day before. The poor woman then probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
waited at the house for the husband and friend that never
came, and then knowing that they must have been killed
took refuge under the bank of the river which ran below the
house. Here she seems to have lain hidden for some days at
least, as she had made a sort of bed of dry grass to lie on
under the bank, and as a pie-dish was found beside her body,
she probably visited the house at nights to get food of some
sort. The agony of mind this poor young woman must have
suffered, one shudders to think of. But at last the Kafirs
found her, and then, poor soul, her troubles were nearly at an
end, for they lost no time in killing her. They appear to
have stoned her to death, as her skull was terribly shattered
and some large round stones taken from the river-bed were
lying beside her corpse. None of her clothes had been
removed, and two rings were still on her finger, on the inner
side of one of which were engraved the words "Sunny Curls,
Mizpah."</p>

<p class="i1">On the afternoon of the day on which the columns
rejoined, the Insiza river was recrossed by the ford on the
main road leading from Belingwe to Bulawayo, and on the
following day, 27th May, the Salisbury contingent, reinforced
by sixty men of Gifford's Horse, left the Bulawayo column,
and went off southwards with the intention of visiting the
Filibusi district, where it was thought that an impi might
be met with, and thence making their way to Bulawayo
by the road which passes Edkins' store, where it may be
remembered a number of white men were murdered at the
first outbreak of the insurrection. As soon as the flying
column under Colonel Beal had left us, Colonel Napier gave
the word to inspan, and an hour later the remainder of the
troops under his command were on their way back to the
capital of Matabeleland, which was finally reached after an
uneventful journey on Sunday, 31st May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p class="i1">As on the road home the column passed near the northern
boundary of my Company's property of Essexvale, I asked
and obtained leave from Colonel Napier to pay a visit in
company with Mr. Blöcker to the homestead where I had
been living in the midst of an apparently happy and contented
native population at the outbreak of the insurrection.
Leaving the camp at daylight, just as the mules were being
inspanned for the morning's trek, we reached the scene of
our agricultural labours after a two hours' ride, only to find
that the house was absolutely gone, literally burnt to ashes,
there being nothing left to mark the spot on which our
pretty cottage had once stood but the stone pillars and solid
iron shoes on which it had rested. The roof of the stable
had been burnt too, as well as all the outhouses, and a
waggon, under which last wood must have been piled in
order to set it alight. The only building which had not been
destroyed was the kitchen, which, having been built very
solidly of stone with an iron roof, was practically fireproof.
The mowing machine and rake had not been touched, nor had
the ploughs been interfered with. In the vegetable garden
we found any amount of cabbages, cauliflowers, onions,
carrots, parsnips, beetroot, tomatoes, etc., which had ripened
since the natives had left, and we loaded up our horses with
as much as they could carry. The potatoes had all been
dug up by some animals, probably porcupines. We visited
some of the native villages close round the homestead, but
found them entirely empty, having been probably deserted
since the time when the Matabele burnt my house down.
After having off-saddled our horses for a short time, we rode
back with our load of vegetables to the column, which we
found laagered up some six miles farther along the road
than where we had left it in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Shortly</span> after the return of Colonel Napier's column from
the Insiza district, Major-General Sir Frederick Carrington
reached Bulawayo with his very able and carefully-chosen
staff, and at once took over the command of all the forces in
Matabeleland. And here I ought perhaps to close my
narrative, which I only intend to be a history of the efforts
made by the colonists themselves to suppress the native
insurrection, before the arrival in Matabeleland of the relief
forces sent up to their assistance. However, at the risk of
wearying my readers, I will ask them to have patience yet a
little longer until I bring my story up to the date of the disbandment
of the Bulawayo Field Force. Some time before
the return of Colonel Napier's column, the force raised by
Colonel Plumer (of the York and Lancaster Regiment) for the
relief of the colonists in Matabeleland had reached Bulawayo,
and had already had a successful engagement with the rebels,
whom he had dislodged from the positions they had taken up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
on the Umguza, some twelve miles from Bulawayo, to which
they had retired after having been driven from the immediate
vicinity of the town by the sortie under Captain Macfarlane
on 25th April.</p>

<p class="i1">As a detachment of the Bulawayo Field Force and some
of Colenbrander's colonial natives took part in this expedition,
I will, before proceeding further, give a short account of what
took place. Acting under instructions from headquarters,
Captain Knapp of the Bulawayo Field Force left Bulawayo
at 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> on the night of 24th May in command of a detachment
of forty men of Gifford's Horse, with orders to report
himself to Major Watts at Government House. On his
arrival there the latter officer was found to be in readiness to
move with the men under his command, and at about 11.30
<span class="sc">P.M.</span> the whole force marched in a north-westerly direction,
holding a course across country between the Umguza and
Khami rivers, whilst at the same time Colonel Plumer
moved out of Bulawayo with another column, taking a line
parallel to the course followed by Major Watts. During
this night march Captain Knapp was in command of the
advance, himself leading the one detachment of Gifford's
Horse on the right front of the column, whilst Lieutenant
Warwick led the other half on the left. Colenbrander's boys
under Lieutenant Mullins were placed in the centre of the
advanced line.</p>

<p class="i1">At about 2.30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> Captain Knapp came suddenly in contact
with the enemy's outposts, who immediately opened fire
on his party in the darkness. Captain Knapp at once dismounted
his men and kept the rebels from charging by
pouring volleys into the thickets where they were concealed.
He was soon joined by Lieutenant Warwick and the Colonial
Boys under Lieutenant Mullins, but it was not until Major
Watts had come up with the main body and the Maxim had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
been brought into action that the enemy's fire was completely
silenced.</p>

<p class="i1">When the firing commenced, Colonel Plumer and his
men were not very far off on the left flank, and their course
was at once directed towards the spot where the engagement
appeared to be proceeding. Thus the two columns joined
forces soon after the enemy had retired, when a square was
formed, and a good watch kept during the remaining hours of
darkness. However, no further attack was made.</p>

<p class="i1">During the first attack, Mr. Hamilton, who was acting as
galloper to Captain Knapp, was shot through both legs,
whilst one of the Colonial Boys was badly wounded and
several horses killed.</p>

<p class="i1">At daylight the following morning Captain Knapp and
Captain Coope were sent out to look for the enemy, and the
latter officer coming across a small party of them, he at once
attacked with the force under his command, consisting of
twenty white men and some of Radikladi's Bamangwato
natives, and drove the rebels back on their main body, which
was found to be in a strong position amongst some thickly-wooded
ridges about two miles to the west of Colonel
Plumer's camp.</p>

<p class="i1">At about half-past seven or eight o'clock the whole column
was moved forwards to attack them, Captain Coope's Scouts
being in advance on the right, whilst Captain Knapp with the
troopers of Gifford's Horse occupied a similar position on the
left. These two officers, after galloping to the foot of the first
ridge occupied by the rebels, there dismounted their men, and
then in the face of a heavy fire, led them on foot most gallantly
against the hidden enemy, whom they succeeded in driving
from their most advanced position.</p>

<p class="i1">In this attack two of Captain Knapp's men were severely
wounded, Sergeant Peacock being shot in the stomach, whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Trooper Slowey had his right leg so badly shattered that
amputation of the limb was found necessary.</p>

<p class="i1">The enemy's first line of defence having been taken in
this brilliant manner by the advance guard, the whole column
under Colonel Plumer then came into action, and the rebels
were driven from three densely-wooded ridges successively
into the open valley of the Umguza, and were then pursued
for a distance of three miles. When the pursuit was over,
the horses were off-saddled on the bank of the Umguza and
allowed to rest until 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, at which hour a start was made
for Mr. Crewe's farm of Redbank on the Khami river, some
sixteen miles from Bulawayo, where it was believed that a
large impi was camped in a very strong position. Captain
Knapp now took charge of the right-hand section of the
advance guard, and Captain Coope with his Scouts was placed
on the left.</p>

<p class="i1">After having proceeded for about two hours, the latter
officer sent a messenger to Captain Knapp to inform him that
the enemy were in force on his left. They then joined forces
and attacked the Kafirs, who were in a strong position on a
wooded hill, to reach which two deep gullies had to be
crossed under a very heavy fire. Here one of Coope's Scouts
was shot dead (Trooper Hays), whilst Mr. Gordon Forbes,
who had accompanied the expedition as a volunteer, had a
very narrow escape. He had crossed a dry gully with four
of Captain Coope's Scouts, when Kafirs showed themselves
on either side at a distance of only thirty yards and fired on
the white men. Mr. Gordon Forbes' horse was shot in two
places, and, falling with him, pinned him to the ground, the
men who were with him retreating under the heavy fire,
and had not some more of Coope's Scouts come up and
pulled him out he would undoubtedly have been killed. At
this time, too, one of Radikladi's boys was wounded in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
face and another horse killed. The main column then
coming up, the enemy were driven from their position and
pursued through the bush till dusk, Colonel Plumer taking
up his quarters for the night in the camp on the top of
the hill from which the rebels had been driven.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following day scouts were sent out to endeavour
to discover the position of the enemy, but no trace of them
could be found, so, as the horses were very much knocked
up, a return to Bulawayo was decided upon. During these
skirmishes Captain Knapp lost five horses, in addition to the
two men of his troop who were badly wounded, whilst
Captain Coope also had several horses killed. These two
officers and their men, being always in advance of the main
column, naturally got the lion's share of the fighting. They
were both thanked for the gallant way in which they had led
their men by their commanding officer, Colonel Plumer, who
also complimented Mr. Maurice Gifford on the excellent
service rendered by the troop of horse which bore his
name.</p>

<p class="i1">During the first week in June, General Carrington determined
to send out three patrols simultaneously with the
object of thoroughly clearing the country of rebels to the
west, north, and north-east of Bulawayo, before making an
attack with the combined forces on the impis of Babian,
Umlugulu, and Sikombo, who, it was known, had taken up
strong positions in the Matopo Hills, from which they could
only be driven with great difficulty and at the expense of a
heavy loss of life on the side of the attacking party. Thus,
towards the end of the week Colonel Plumer proceeded with
a force of some 600 men to the Khami river, the course
of which stream it was his intention to follow to its junction
with the Gwai, whilst on Friday, 5th June, Captain Macfarlane
got off with 300 mounted white men and 100 Colonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Boys for the Umguza, which he was determined to thoroughly
clear of rebels along its whole course. Mr. Cecil Rhodes,
Sir Charles Metcalfe, and Mr. Weston Jarvis accompanied
the latter force.</p>

<p class="i1">Both these patrols were unsuccessful in coming up with
any large body of the rebels, who dispersed and fled as the
white men advanced. Thus, although some kraals were
burnt and a good deal of grain taken and destroyed, no
decisive engagement took place, and no heavy blow could
be dealt at the ever-vanishing foe. Colonel Plumer's column
got back to their quarters on the Khami river on Wednesday,
24th June, whilst Captain Macfarlane's men did not return to
Bulawayo until Friday, 3rd July.</p>

<p class="i1">Before these patrols left, Colonel Beal, who it may be
remembered had parted company with Colonel Napier at the
Insiza river, reached Bulawayo and formed a laager about
two miles out of town to the right of the main road to
Salisbury. It had been arranged that on the morning after
Captain Macfarlane got away with his men to the lower
Umguza, another patrol was to leave town under the command
of Colonel Spreckley for the purpose of establishing
forts at Shiloh and Inyati, and to this patrol I had been
attached with a few of my men, the majority of my troop
being stationed at Fort Marquand.</p>

<p class="i1">Every preparation had been made for an early start on
the Saturday morning, when late on Friday evening a report
came in that there was a large impi camped on the Umguza,
at the ford on the main road to Salisbury. It appeared that
Sir Charles Metcalfe and the American Scout Burnham, who
had been riding out to Colonel Beal's camp, having missed
their way in the dark, had ridden down the main road to the
Umguza, and had there seen a line of camp-fires, extending
over half a mile of ground, along the wooded ridge beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the river, which could betoken nothing else but that a
Matabele impi had taken up its position there. This news
that a large impi was within six miles of the town having
been confirmed by scouts sent out later on during the Friday
night, Colonel Spreckley received orders to make an attack
upon it on the following morning with all the mounted men
he could muster in town, supplemented by the contingent
under Colonel Beal. By nine o'clock a force of some 200
mounted men with three guns was ready, and forthwith set
out for the Umguza. This force was composed of the Scouts
under Captain Grey, a large contingent of Africanders under
Captain Van Niekerk, thirty men under Captain Brand, and
fifteen of my own troop which was all for which horses could
be found.</p>

<p class="i1">On reaching the rising ground about a mile on this side
of the Umguza, we found the Salisbury men drawn up all
ready waiting for us, and they informed us that they had
been watching the Matabele for some time past, and had
seen them leave the camps in which they had slept in a
very leisurely way and take up their positions in the open
bush behind, where they were waiting for us.</p>

<p class="i1">They had not to wait long. The Africanders under
Captain Van Niekerk were ordered to cross the river about
half a mile below the ford, which they did at the same time
that the remainder of Colonel Spreckley's force and the
mounted men of the Salisbury contingent crossed by the
main road, the latter then deploying to the left.</p>

<p class="i1">At this time we were hidden from the Kafirs by the slope
of rising ground behind which they had retreated, but when
this was crested they were seen in the bush little more than
a hundred yards in front of the foremost horsemen. The
order was at once given to charge, on which a whirlwind of
horsemen bore down on them, Grey's Scouts and Brand's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
men being in the centre, the Africanders on the left, and the
Salisbury men on the right.</p>

<p class="i1">On this occasion the Kafirs must have been quite 1000
strong, spread out in skirmishing order through the open
bush in face of the long line of advancing horsemen, yet they
never stood for a moment, but were seized with a panic just
as the smaller number of their compatriots had been when
charged at Thaba Induna, as I have already related. In the
same way as these latter, they fired a hurried ill-aimed volley
and then turned and ran. In the chase which followed, a
large number of them were shot down, and the pursuit was
only abandoned when the fleetest-footed amongst them had
gained the shelter of the belt of thick bush which runs
down from the western side of Thaba Induna towards the
Umguza.</p>

<p class="i1">I am of opinion myself that the Matabele lost more
heavily on this occasion than at any other fight during the
campaign, for the very reason that it was not a fight but only
a pursuit in which the natives were killed as fast as they
were overtaken. Just as on the day at Thaba Induna, so on
this occasion the panic-stricken savages accepted death when
the horsemen came up with them without making any
attempt at resistance, except in a few instances. One man
turned on Trooper Davey of Grey's Scouts and shot him
through the thigh with an old musket at close quarters, the
large bullet smashing the thigh-bone and necessitating the
amputation of the limb; whilst another, leaping out of a
bush, rushed on to Trooper Hamilton of the Salisbury contingent
and stabbed him in the right side, the assegai entering
his liver. Hamilton wrenched the assegai out of his assailant's
hand and then shot him. My old friend, Mr. F. C. Farley of
Grey's Scouts and a well-known figure in the Bulawayo of
to-day, as he was also in the native kraal of Lo Bengula many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
years ago, had too a very narrow escape. He had dismounted
to shoot a Kafir running a short distance in front of him,
when the latter turned and rushed at him shaking his shield
in front of him. Farley luckily carried a double-barrelled
rifle, for he missed the Kafir with the first shot, and only
brought him down with the second barrel when his assailant
was so near him that his assegai struck the ground close to
his feet. Two other men were slightly wounded, but these
were the only casualties on our side, whilst the loss sustained
by the Matabele was very heavy, not only in number, but in
the rank of the men who were killed, for it was naturally
the young and nimble who were able to make good their
escape, whilst the greater part of the older men were overtaken
and slain. Some of the latter, however, outlived this
fatal day by hiding themselves in the midst of thick bushes.</p>

<p class="i1">That this impi should have dared to come close up to
Bulawayo and take up its quarters at a point on the Umguza
where the bush was not nearly so thick as it is farther down
the river, at the point where several large impis had already
tried conclusions and failed to hold their own against the
white men, certainly took everyone by surprise; but since
then several hundred men of this impi have surrendered to
Mr. W. Fynn, and we now know that when they approached
Bulawayo they did so under the superstitious belief that their
enemies would be delivered into their hands by the Umlimo,
and that they would be able to kill them all without any loss
to themselves.</p>

<p class="i1">The story is as follows: Since the outbreak of the
rebellion there has appeared amongst that section of the
insurgents to which the defeated impi belonged a man who
professes himself to be the prophet and mouthpiece of the
"Umlimo" or invisible spirit. This man, it is said, possesses
the power of throwing himself into an ecstatic condition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
under the influence of which he swallows stones, rolls on the
ground, dances on hot ashes, puts burning coals into his
mouth, and goes through many other strange performances.
He is known to the Matabele by the name of "Si ginya
amachi," "He who swallows stones," and his utterances have
come to be implicitly believed in, insomuch that when he
called for an impi to go and destroy all the white men in
Bulawayo, he had no difficulty in getting a number of picked
men from seven different regiments to obey his behests. His
orders were that the men composing this impi should take up
their quarters where we found them on the Salisbury road,
and there wait for the white men to attack them. They were
on no account to endeavour to prevent their enemies from
crossing the Umguza, but were to offer them every encouragement
to do so, "for," said the stone-swallower, "once they
have crossed to the east of the river the Umlimo will strike
them all blind, and you will then be able to kill them without
trouble, and then go on and murder all the women and
children in Bulawayo." As the white men were not struck
blind, whilst on the other hand a large number of the
prophet's dupes lost their lives through their superstitious
belief in his supernatural gifts, it would be interesting to
know how "Si ginya amachi" has accounted to the survivors
for his most dismal failure; for the fact that he has not yet
been put to death seems to show that he has been able to
offer some excuse which has saved his life up to the present
time.</p>

<p class="i1">It is this episode of the killing of a large number of Matabele
at the Umguza by the colonists <i>whom they had come to
kill</i>, of which Mr. Labouchere has made so much capital
lately, and which has enabled him to indulge in so many
sneers against the white settlers in Rhodesia; his stock
phrase being "that the natives are being shot down like game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
at a battue, with apparently as little danger to the shooters
as to those killing hares and rabbits." Now no one knows
better than Mr. Labouchere himself the utter recklessness of
such a statement if applied to the whole campaign, since it
is evident that he is ever on the watch for every scrap of
news emanating from Rhodesia, in the charitable hope of
picking up something discreditable to the settlers or to the
government of the Chartered Company, and he must therefore
be well aware that the number of white men who have been
killed and wounded in the various engagements and skirmishes
that have lately taken place in Matabeleland is very considerable.
But should any one who does me the honour to read my
story be either a constant or a fitful reader of the pages of
<i>Truth</i>, and be inclined to believe that the editor of that journal
is correct in his oft-repeated assertion that the white men
in Matabeleland have suffered an insignificant loss in their
encounters with the natives during the present rebellion, I
would ask such an one to turn to the Appendix at the end of
this book, and look over the lists which I have there given
both of the settlers who were murdered on the first outbreak
of the rebellion, and also of those who have since been killed
and wounded in battle. These lists, if compared with Mr.
Labouchere's statements, will, I think, prove to the most
prejudiced that Truth—the everlasting Truth which we are
told is great and will prevail—is one thing, whilst Mr.
Labouchere's <i>Truth</i>, sold at all the bookstalls at 6d. a copy,
is quite another.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Owing</span> to the delay caused by the attack on and pursuit of
the impi from the Umguza, as I have just narrated, Colonel
Spreckley's patrol did not leave Bulawayo for Shiloh until
the afternoon of the following day, Sunday, 7th June. This
patrol comprised about 330 white men, about half of whom
were mounted, 100 Colonial Boys, and 100 Friendly Matabele—over
500 men altogether.</p>

<p class="i1">As we did not proceed along the main road, but first took
a branch track to the old Imbezu kraal, and then followed
the course of the Kotki river until we struck the main road,
we did not reach the site of the old police camp near Shiloh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
mission station until Thursday, 11th June. Up to this time
we had not seen a single native, whilst all the kraals we
passed had been long deserted and all stores of grain removed,
so that our horses and mules, having to depend entirely on
the dry scanty grass for their sustenance, lost condition
rapidly.</p>

<p class="i1">One day we outspanned close to a miner's camp, which
was situated on a rise above the Kotki river, and as I was
field officer for the day and had to post the videttes, I placed
two of them on the site of the mining camp. Here we found
the dead bodies of three natives, who proved to be Zambesi
boys who had been working at the mine at the time when
the rebellion broke out. On inquiry I found that this camp
had belonged to an American miner named Jack Stuart—a
lieutenant in Grey's Scouts—from whom I learned, that on
hearing rumours towards the end of March that a native
rising was imminent, he and his partner had gone in to
Bulawayo to ascertain if there was any truth in the report.
Six Zambesi boys were left working in the shaft, which had
been sunk on a reef just alongside of the camp, and two days
later one of these boys came to town and reported that on
the previous evening a party of Matabele had visited the
mine, and forthwith proceeded to murder all the Zambesi boys
they found there. He himself, he said, had managed to
escape by running, but he thought that all his companions
had been killed. A few days later, however, another of these
boys turned up who had been very badly wounded and left
for dead by the Matabele.</p>

<p class="i1">It appears that, on seeing two of his friends attacked, this
boy had made a bolt for it, but was overtaken and knocked
down by a heavy blow on the back of the head from a knob-kerry.
He fell on his face stunned, and was then stabbed in
the back with an assegai, the weapon being driven clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
through him, and then twice nearly but not quite withdrawn
from the wound, and again driven through him, so that,
although there was only one wound on his back, there were
three in front, where the point of the assegai had come
through, just below his breast-bone, and his right lung must
have been punctured in three different places. This boy
would seem to have lain a day and a night, insensible, where
he fell, but on regaining consciousness had found strength
enough to walk to Bulawayo, some twenty miles distant
from the mining camp where he had been knocked down,
assegaied, and left for dead.</p>

<p class="i1">On his arrival in town he was at once taken to the
hospital, and, owing to the kind nursing and skilful treatment
which he received there, he in a few weeks' time completely
recovered, and although he still bears the scars of the wounds
which he received, his general health appears to be as good
as ever it was.</p>

<p class="i1">On Friday, 12th June, the day after our arrival on the
site of the old police camp, a fort was built, and here Native
Commissioner Lanning was left in charge with a garrison of
about seventy white men and twenty Friendly Matabele and
a stock of provisions sufficient to last for two months.</p>

<p class="i1">On the following morning we struck across country towards
the Queen's Mine, a property belonging to Willoughby's
Consolidated Company. That night we slept on the way there,
and the fresh tracks of Kafirs and cattle having been seen
late in the afternoon, a patrol was sent after them very early
the next morning, the column shortly afterwards getting under
way and arriving at the mining camp at about eight o'clock.</p>

<p class="i1">Here it was found that although a good deal of property
had been destroyed by the Kafirs, but little damage had been
done to the machinery and pumping gear, the savages probably
not having recognised its value nor been sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
energetic to give themselves the trouble of smashing it up.
Another short trek in the afternoon brought us to the ford
of the Impembisi river, on the main road between Bulawayo
and the mission station of Inyati. Here the patrol which
had left us in the early morning under Captain Gradwell
rejoined us just at dusk, having been unsuccessful in coming
up with any Kafirs or cattle, all of whom seemed to have
gone down the Impembisi river.</p>

<p class="i1">As the mules and horses were now getting into very low
condition, it was determined not to take the whole column
on to Inyati, but only to send on the contingent who were to
remain in garrison there under the command of Lieutenant
Banks-Wright, together with another 100 men who were to
return to the main column as soon as the fort was in a fair
way towards completion. This force was accompanied by
four waggons carrying provisions and other necessaries for
the garrison of the fort, and the Rev. Mr. Rees also went with
it, in order to bury the remains of the six white men who had
been murdered near the police camp of Inyati on 27th March.</p>

<p class="i1">Five of these bodies were found lying on the roadside
near together, about a mile on this side of the police camp,
while the sixth was discovered near the camp itself. The
corpses had been partially mummified by the dryness of the
atmosphere, and were all quite recognisable. Mr. Graham,
the native commissioner, and his four companions had
evidently been attacked by a large force of Kafirs soon after
they had left the police station, and were killed whilst defending
the waggon on which they were travelling to Bulawayo.
In addition to their bodies the remains of two Colonial Boys
were also found who had been murdered at the same time as
their white masters.</p>

<p class="i1">That Mr. Graham and his companions had made a good
fight of it, and sold their lives dearly, was evident from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
number of empty cartridge-cases which were found on the
ground round their dead bodies, Lieutenant Howard having
picked up and counted eighty-five. As, however, the Matabele
had removed their dead, it is quite impossible to say what loss
they had suffered. The murdered men were all buried with
military honours in the cemetery near the old mission station
by Mr. Rees. This gentleman himself, with his wife and
family, must have had a very narrow escape, as they only left
the mission station on the 26th March, the day before Mr.
Graham and his companions were attacked and killed; and
they must too have only just passed through the Elibaini
Hills on their way to Bulawayo before the rebels collected
there. Both mission houses at Inyati were found to have
been burnt down and destroyed, as well as the church, in
which it was evident that large quantities of wood had been
piled up in order to set light to the heavy beams supporting
the roof. The natives had also taken the trouble to chop
down fruit trees and ornamental shrubs growing round the
mission houses, and had evidently done their best, not only
to rid themselves of the presence of all white men in the
country, but also to destroy as far as possible all traces of
their ever having been there.</p>

<p class="i1">On Wednesday morning the men who had been sent to
assist in building the fort at Inyati returned to the Impembisi,
and in the afternoon the whole column moved some four
miles up the river to Mr. Fynn's farm. On the morning of
the same day Lieutenant Mullins—Mr. Colenbrander's
brother-in-law—had been sent on to this point with some
fifty Colonial Boys to look for grain, and had come across a
considerable number of armed Kafirs in a very broken,
densely-wooded piece of country, just to the east of the Impembisi
river. As it was impossible for Lieutenant Mullins
to tell the numbers of the rebels in the broken country, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
retired with his Colonial Boys to the top of a single hill to
the west of the river, and sent back to camp for reinforcements.
Captain Grey was at once sent on with his Scouts,
and the whole column followed more leisurely, arriving at
Fynn's farm just before sundown.</p>

<p class="i1">Captain Grey had seen a considerable number of natives,
evidently watching his men from the tops of different kopjes,
but as the country they were in was altogether impracticable
for horses, he was unable to attack them, and they on their
side showed no disposition to come out of the hills. At a
council of war that evening it was determined to endeavour
to clear the hills in the morning with as large a force of footmen
as could be spared from the laager; Grey's Scouts at the
same time being sent round at the back of the hills in order
to cut off any Kafirs who might be driven out of them into
the level country beyond. The general impression in camp
was that the Kafirs were in force, and that we should have
all our work cut out to drive them out of their positions.
And so we should have had, if they had only remained to
dispute our advance. However, leaving the laager on the
following morning just as day was breaking, we entered the
hills at sunrise, and went right through them without seeing
a sign of the rebels, who we found had decamped during the
night and fled to what they considered a more secure stronghold—to
wit, the "Intabas a Mambo," a sort of miniature
Matopos some twenty miles farther eastward.</p>

<p class="i1">To this fastness it was not possible for Colonel Spreckley
to follow them, so, as we met no other natives during our
farther progress up the river to Mr. Arthur Rhodes' homestead,
nor on our return journey from there to Bulawayo,
we had absolutely no fighting during the whole trip.</p>

<p class="i1">Curiously enough, the temporary huts in which Mr. Fynn
had been living before the outbreak of the insurrection had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
not been burnt, and on going up to a kraal some few miles
higher up the river, where had dwelt a native to whom he
had entrusted some Merino sheep, pigs, and a number of very
handsome black Spanish fowls, Mr. Fynn found the fowls and
pigs still there and in very good condition, and on making a
closer examination observed fresh Kafir footprints, and therefore
came to the conclusion that the man he had left in
charge of his live stock was still looking after it, retiring into
the hills by day and feeding his master's pigs and fowls by
night. Mr. Fynn therefore asked Colonel Spreckley to allow
him to take two friends that evening, and return to the kraal
in the hope of being able to intercept his servant, and bring
him down to the camp.</p>

<p class="i1">The plan succeeded perfectly, for just after dusk the man
came along the footpath leading from the river to the kraal,
and was suddenly confronted by Mr. Fynn, who had been
waiting for him concealed behind a bush. The Kafir was at
first very much taken aback, but when he recognised his
master, he burst out laughing and said: "Why, is it you,
Willy? you've caught me now." This man was a native of
Delagoa Bay, and being lame had been able to escape being
forced into taking part in the rebellion, and ever since the
outbreak had been able to surreptitiously look after a portion
of his master's property, for though the Merino sheep had
been driven off to the "Intabas a Mambo," the pigs and fowls
had been left, and these the faithful servant had fed and
watered regularly every night.</p>

<p class="i1">He was able to give us a great deal of useful information,
and told us that the men who had been seen the day before
amongst the hills on the other side of the Impembisi river
were a portion of the impi which had suffered so heavily at
the Umguza, on Saturday, 6th June. He informed us that
they were thoroughly disheartened, and wished to surrender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
but were afraid to do so, knowing that they had made the
white men very angry by murdering their women and children.
He gave the names of thirteen headmen of kraals who had
been killed on that fatal day, all of whom had been personally
known to Mr. Fynn, as they had been one and all living on
Mr. Arthur Rhodes' block of farms before the rebellion broke
out.</p>

<p class="i1">The next three days were spent in collecting grain, an
immense amount being found stored in all the kraals on Mr.
Arthur Rhodes' farms. In almost every kraal was found
something or other which had been taken from his homestead,
which had evidently been completely looted before it
was burnt down. Several hundred head of cattle were also
recovered which had been stolen from Mr. Rhodes, but the
rinderpest was amongst them and they died by the score
every day. As it was very important to get as much corn as
possible to Bulawayo for the use of the horses and mules
stabled there, and it could not be all carried in at once on the
waggons at Colonel Spreckley's disposal, a large amount was
stored in a kraal near Mr. Fynn's dwelling-house, and Captain
Robinson with fifty men and some Friendly Matabele left in
charge of it until it could be sent for.</p>

<p class="i1">When this matter had been arranged, the column moved
up to Mr. Arthur Rhodes' desolated homestead, which was
reached at mid-day on Sunday, 21st June, and leaving again
the same evening arrived in Bulawayo two days later after an
absence of seventeen days.</p>

<p class="i1">On our arrival in town we heard for the first time of the
insurrection which had broken out in Mashunaland, and
learned the sad news that many settlers had been murdered
in the outlying districts of the country. Colonel Beal was at
this time already on his way back to Salisbury with the entire
force under his command, and two days after our return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Bulawayo sixty more mounted men of Grey's Scouts and
Gifford's Horse, under the command of Captain the Hon. C.
White, were despatched to the assistance of their fellow-colonists
in Eastern Rhodesia.</p>

<p class="i1">When the secret history of the rebellion in Mashunaland
comes to be known, I fancy it will be found that it was
brought about by the leaders of the Matabele insurrection
through the instrumentality of the Umlimos or prophets, who
exist amongst all the tribes in Mashunaland, where they are
known as "Mondoros," <i>i.e.</i> "Lions." In the district to the
north-west of Salisbury there lives a prophetess known as
"Salugazana," whose magical powers were apparently believed
in by Lo Bengula, as he was in the habit of sending
messengers to consult with her.</p>

<p class="i1">Now, we know that messages have been sent to this wise
woman either by the leaders of the Matabele or the agents of
one of the Umlimos or priests during the present rebellion,
and I think that she was in all probability informed that the
white men had all been killed in Matabeleland, including the
column under Colonel Beal, and asked to disseminate this
news amongst all the members of the priestly families throughout
the country, bidding them at the same time to call upon
the people to destroy the few surviving white men still left
alive in the eastern province of Rhodesia.</p>

<p class="i1">As for the rising in Mashunaland proving that the natives
of that country have been very cruelly treated by the whites,
as Mr. Labouchere has asserted, it really demonstrates nothing
of the kind; it only shows that the Mashunas imagined that
they would be able to possess themselves of a vast amount of
valuable loot with little danger to themselves, and no fear of
punishment. The kindness or otherwise of the government
of the whites would not be likely to weigh with them one
way or the other, given the belief in their own power to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the whites and take possession of their property without fear
of retribution.</p>

<p class="i1">That is the crux of the whole question; for no one who
has lived long amongst the various peoples generically known
as Mashunas, whose principal characteristics are avarice,
cowardice, and a complete callousness to the sufferings of
others, will be inclined to doubt that were they governed by
an angel from heaven, they would infallibly kill that angel,
if his wing feathers were of any value to them, provided that
they believed at the same time that the crime might be
committed with impunity.</p>

  <div class="caption">CAPTAIN TYRIE LAING<br />
    who was in command at BELINGWE on the outbreak
    of the native insurrection.</div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Towards the end of June Captain Laing arrived in Bulawayo 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
in command of the relief forces which had been sent to
him from Tuli and Victoria, Lieutenant Stoddart being left in
command of the laager at Belingwe. On his way to Bulawayo,
Captain Laing had had several successful engagements with
the tribes in rebellion living between Belingwe and Filibusi,
who are all Mashunas, with a small number of Matabele living
amongst them; these latter having been the ringleaders of the
rebellion in this part of the country. Captain Laing received
very valuable assistance from Matibi, a Mashuna chief living
near the Bubyi river, who sent several hundred of his men to
accompany him on his march to Bulawayo. These men did
good service and fought well when supported by white men.
They accompanied the column as far as the Umzingwani
river, twenty-five miles from Bulawayo, returning home from
this point loaded up with loot of all kinds which they had
taken from their rebel countrymen.</p>

<p class="i1">Besides Matibi, it is worthy of remark that Chibi and
Chilimanzi, the two most important chiefs in the district
between Belingwe and Victoria, have both not only held
aloof from the present rebellion, but have given active assistance
to the whites since the outbreak of hostilities, whilst
Gutu's people—the Zinjanja—have also remained loyal to
the Government.</p>

<p class="i1">I have now, I think, given a fairly comprehensive history
of the late insurrection in Matabeleland up to the time when,
relief forces having arrived in the country, it was deemed
expedient to disband the volunteer troops which had been
originally raised to suppress the rebellion, and I will therefore
leave to abler and more accustomed pens than mine the
task of describing all the subsequent incidents of a campaign
which we will hope is now fast drawing to an end. I will
only say that no one appreciates more than myself the excessive
difficulties that have been encountered in dislodging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
rebels from such fastnesses as the Intabas a Mambo and the
Matopo Hills, or recognises more fully the brave work which
has been done under the guidance of Major-General Sir
Frederick Carrington, by Colonel Plumer, Major Baden Powell,
and all the officers and men under their command.</p>

<p class="i1">The Bulawayo Field Force was not actually disbanded
until Saturday, 4th July, upon which occasion the assembled
troops were addressed by Lord Grey after they had been first
inspected by Major-General Sir Frederick Carrington. The
Administrator concluded his address to the members of the
force in the following words:—"All of you have acquitted
yourselves as brave men, and I would particularly commend
the conduct of Colonel Napier, who throughout the campaign
has performed his very arduous duties so satisfactorily. But
mingled with our enjoyment there must be some pain in
looking back upon many of the episodes of this rebellion.
The Company has done its best to look after your comfort,
but you have undergone notwithstanding some severe hardships,
which, however, you have borne like men; and the
only complaint I have heard is that you were not always
able to go out against the enemy, but had to perform as well
the hard and monotonous work of laager and fort duty.
Many of you have a Matabele memento in the shape of a
wound, the mark of which you will carry to your graves.
Many too have lost friends; and possibly none of us realise
the loss of life which has taken place both before and during
hostilities; for our losses have been heavy, and form a large
percentage of the total number of people who were engaged
in the exploitation of the country. I cannot refer to individual
cases of bravery where all have done so well, but I would
again especially mention Colonel Napier's services to the
country. He has exhibited remarkable tact and judgment,
and has freely given great assistance to the Government. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
regret that he is to-day retiring from the service, but I hope
that he will continue to give us the benefit of his experience.
I do not like to mention any particular troop, as each has
acted so creditably, but I would note the excellent services
rendered by the Africander Corps in this war, as showing the
whole world the complete brotherhood which exists between
the two races of Dutchmen and Britons in Rhodesia. I trust
that an Africander troop will again form part of the new force
which is now being raised by the Government. Information
reached this country by last mail that Her Majesty has been
pleased to allow a medal to be worn for the last Matabele
war, and I shall represent strongly to Her Majesty that the
same honour ought to be conferred on the members of the
Bulawayo Field Force. You have as much right and title to
the distinction as those who fought in the first war, and I
hope there will be a sufficient number struck for both those
who fought in the first war and those who have fought during
the present rebellion. I thank you for your assistance in the
past, and I hope you will remain in the country to witness
the prosperity which is certain to come."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="i1">And now, Lord Grey's speech to the members of the
Bulawayo Field Force having formed the closing scene in the
history of the corps, whose deeds in the cause of civilisation,
and for the preservation of British supremacy in Rhodesia, it
has been my endeavour to describe in the foregoing pages, it
only remains for me to bid adieu to my readers, and to hope
that the intrinsic interest of the scenes I have attempted to
describe in very plain and homely fashion may be sufficient
to atone for the deficiencies which will doubtless be only too
apparent in my literary style.</p>

<h2><a name="SUPPLEMENTARY_CHAPTER" id="SUPPLEMENTARY_CHAPTER"></a>SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER</h2>
</div>

<p class="ac">CONTAINING A FEW THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS UPON MATTERS
RHODESIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN</p>


<p class="i1">No one, I think, who has carefully read the little history
which I have just brought to a close, can fail to have
been struck by the conspicuous part which has been played
by the Dutch settlers in Matabeleland in the recent struggle
for supremacy between the white invaders of that country
and the native black races; and it will probably come as a
surprise to many to find that the Boer element is so strong
as it is in Rhodesia, for that country has always been considered
more exclusively British as regards its white population
than any other State in South Africa, not except Natal
and the Eastern Province of the Cape Colony, both of which
territories, though almost purely British in the large towns,
yet possess a large Boer population in the farming districts,
whose ancestors were living on the land before the arrival
of the British colonists.</p>

<p class="i1">But, in the opening up and colonisation of Rhodesia by
means of the pioneer expedition of the British South Africa
Company, which took possession of Eastern Mashunaland in
1890, a new departure was made in South African history,
for the British became the pioneers instead of the Dutch, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a British colony was established in the far interior of the
country many hundred miles to the north of the most
northerly Dutch state; and it is the fact that the occupation
of Mashunaland in 1890 and the invasion and conquest
of Matabeleland in 1893 were purely British enterprises,
which has, I think, created the belief generally held in England
that Rhodesia at the present day is a purely British
colony. Yet this is not the case, for within the British
state there are two Boer colonies, the one of which has been
established subsequent to the Matabele war in the country to
the south of Fort Charter, whilst the other has occupied the
hills and valleys of Gazaland since the latter part of 1891.
Besides these agricultural colonies, where a number of contiguous
farms are occupied by Boers who have settled on the
land with their wives and families, there are many other
Boer farmers scattered throughout Rhodesia, whilst up to
the time when the rinderpest destroyed all their cattle, a large
number of Dutchmen were constantly present in the country,
earning their living with their waggons and oxen as carriers
from one district to another.</p>

<p class="i1">When the rebellion broke out, Commandant Van Rensberg
at once formed an Africander Corps, the great majority
of whose members were Boers, although it numbered in its
ranks a certain proportion of colonists of British blood,
and it is a matter of history that these Dutchmen under
Commandant Van Rensberg and Captains Van Niekerk and
Pittendrigh have done splendid service during the recent
insurrection in Matabeleland, and have fought side by side
with Grey's Scouts and Gifford's Horse, and all the other
troops of the Bulawayo Field Force, in a way which has won
for them the admiration and respect of their brothers in arms
and fellow-colonists of British blood; and that the mutual
esteem and good fellowship engendered between the two races
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
during the recent time of common peril may be fostered and
maintained in the coming years ought not only to be the
earnest desire of all thinking men, but should be also one of
the main objects constantly kept in view by the English
Administrator of these territories.</p>

  <div class="caption">COMMANDANT VAN RENSBERG<br />
    who raised the Africander Corps of the Bulawayo Field Force.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="i1">Many years ago, at a time when the scheme for the colonisation
of the high and healthy plateaus lying between the
Limpopo and the Zambesi had not yet assumed definite shape
in the fertile brain of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, I remember writing
in the course of an article, published, I think, in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>, that those territories were in my opinion the natural
heritage of the British and Dutch colonists in the older
states of South Africa. My forecast was true enough, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
although in its first inception the colonisation of Rhodesia
was a purely British enterprise, yet to-day, in less than six
years from the date when the Union Jack was hoisted at
Fort Salisbury and the country proclaimed to be a province of
Britain, it already numbers amongst its inhabitants a very
considerable number of Dutch Boers, who form an element
of the population, which in all South African history has
been found indispensable for the gradual conversion of vast
uncultured wastes into civilised states.</p>

<p class="i1">Now I might, I think, have gone further, and said that the
whole of temperate South Africa (in which must be included
the high plateaus lying between the Limpopo and the Zambesi)
was the joint possession of the British and Dutch races;
for in all the states of that country, the old and the new
alike, we find the two races living side by side, whilst, curiously
enough, in the British province of the Cape Colony the
Dutch outnumber the British, and in the Boer State of the
Transvaal the British outnumber the Dutch.</p>

<p class="i1">Throughout South Africa the Dutch live away from the
towns on their farms, and, speaking generally, form the agricultural
and pastoral population of the country. They are
naturally a kindly, hospitable race; but as the inevitable
result of their surroundings and the circumstances in which
they have lived for generations, they are for the most part
very poorly educated, and therefore ignorant, unprogressive
and bigoted; whilst among the descendants of the "voor-trekkers,"
who some forty years ago abandoned their farms in
the Cape Colony and fled, with their wives and their children,
their flocks and their herds, into the unknown interior beyond
the great Orange River, in order to escape from what they
considered the injustice of British rule, there exists an ingrained
hatred and distrust, not of the individual Englishman,
but of the government of the country under whose flag they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
believe their fathers suffered wrong, and it is this sentiment
which at the present moment, unfortunately, is being used as
a political lever, which threatens nothing but disaster to the
whole of South Africa, by the anti-British, but non-Boer
adventurers, who are fighting for their own hands in Pretoria.</p>

<p class="i1">The recent deplorable invasion of Transvaal territory by a
British force in defiance of all international law, to accomplish
I still fail to understand what, has naturally exasperated
the Dutch of the Transvaal, and caused them to look
upon everything British with more distrust and suspicion than
ever; but the history of that disastrous expedition, evoking
as it did the most intense national sentiment, not only
amongst the Boers of the Transvaal, but also in a somewhat
milder degree perhaps, though still in a most pronounced
manner, amongst their compatriots in the Orange Free State,
coupled with the very notorious fact that in the exclusively
Dutch districts both of the Cape Colony and Natal a very
strong anti-British feeling was excited, must have convinced
even the most infatuated that a conflict between Dutchmen
and Englishmen, in whatever portion of South Africa it may
arise, will be but the prelude to a war between the two races
throughout every province from Cape Agulhas to the Zambesi—a
war which would retard the general progress of the country
for a generation, which would be infinitely disastrous to both
races engaged in the struggle, and yet could be beneficial to
neither, no matter which proved victorious.</p>

<p class="i1">In future let us hope that neither young military aspirants
to fame, who, being ignorant of everything concerning South
Africa, would yet climb their way to glory over the dead
bodies of British and Dutch South Africans with the most
light-hearted carelessness, just in the way of their professional
business, nor cold-hearted self-seeking foreign politicians,
who would use the ignorance and prejudice of the Boer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
assist them in gratifying their jealous hatred of England, will
be allowed to sway the councils of the statesmen, British
or Boer, on whose decree the fate of South Africa really
depends.</p>

<p class="i1">Not being a politician nor anything else but a wandering
Englishman with a taste for natural history and sport, it may
be held most presumptuous on my part to have written as I
have done; but yet I have the most profound conviction that
a war between the Boers and British in South Africa can
only be a calamity of incalculable dimensions to both races;
whilst the name of that statesman, whether Boer or Briton,
who should without just cause on the one hand "cry havoc
and let loose the dogs of war," or on the other compel the
slipping of such dogs by fatuous obstinacy, and a cynical
disregard for all the principles of enlightened government,
will be assuredly held in execration by unborn generations of
Boers and Britons alike. Neither race can get away from or
do away with the other, and therefore both must try and rub
off their mutual prejudices, and live harmoniously together.</p>

<p class="i1">This is not difficult in a new country like Rhodesia, where
the representatives of the two peoples are in the nature of
things thrown much together, and where there has always
been a good understanding between them, which has of late
been very much strengthened by the mutual assistance given
by each to the other during the recent troublous times; and
the fact that in these territories a very good understanding
prevails between the Dutch and British gives one reason to
hope that in time a similar state of things may be attained in
the Transvaal, although unfortunately in that State there
are several factors which militate against such a result being
speedily arrived at.</p>

<p class="i1">In the first place, the great mass of the European population
in the Transvaal, the greater part of which is British,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
resides in one great city, where it leads its own life, and does
not come in contact with the Dutch farming population, of
which it knows neither the language nor the history, and
with whose modes of thought and manner of life it is
altogether out of sympathy; whilst, on the other hand, the
rough Boer, in too many cases, despises the ultra-civilised,
sharp-witted, faultlessly-dressed European, and does not
recognise that many amongst them are fine fellows and good
sportsmen, and are capable of throwing off their coats and
doing a day's work, hunting or fighting, with the roughest
Boer amongst them, should occasion serve.</p>

<p class="i1">And yet these mutual prejudices and misunderstandings
between the two peoples might easily be rubbed away if it
were not for the presence of an anti-British clique of Hollanders
and Germans in Pretoria, whose object it is to widen the
breach between the Boers and the British; and as many of
these men occupy official positions in the Government of the
country, and are therefore more in touch with the Boer
legislators than the citizens of Johannesburg can hope to be,
they have opportunities which they do not fail to use of
increasing the distrust and suspicion already existing between
the two races who alone have got to work out the destiny of
South Africa between them, and amongst whom they are
only meddlesome self-seeking interlopers.</p>

<p class="i1">All the various States of South Africa will no doubt be
united sooner or later under one flag, but I am beginning to
have my doubts as to what flag that will be. It is true that
at the present time there exists in South Africa a very large
British population of highly intelligent and energetic men,
who have been attracted to that country by the diamond
and gold fields. That population is constantly increasing,
but it is not one which settles on the land. It is rather a
population which has come to the country on a visit, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
endeavour to make a fortune with which to retire to the old
country, and as the recent census taken in Johannesburg
has shown, it is for the most part composed of young men,
the greater number of whom are unmarried. Now I suppose
it is conceivable that a day may come, say in fifty, eighty or
a hundred years time, when all the treasures have been dug
up out of the South African earth; and should such a day
arrive, is it not also conceivable that the great mining populations
which have built the cities of Kimberley and
Johannesburg in what a few years ago was a sparsely-inhabited
wilderness, may dwindle down to comparatively
small proportions, leaving the Boer population, which during
all that time will have been increasing at a very rapid rate,
once more numerically very much in excess of the British?</p>

<p class="i1">It does not appear to me very probable that during the
present generation at least the Boers, either of the Transvaal
or the Orange Free State, are likely (except under compulsion,
which presupposes a deplorable war) to enter any confederacy
of South African States, on any terms whatever, under the
British flag; and therefore should the large British mining
population now existent in the country gradually vanish,
and the Boer population at the same time very much increase,
the eventful confederation may take place under some other
flag than the Union Jack. After all, as the Boers hold as
large a stake in land, if not in wealth, as the British in South
Africa, and as they were the first comers, and can lay claim
to having killed off as many natives, and generally prepared
as much country for occupation by white men, as the British,
I think they are entitled to some consideration in the matter
of the flag which is eventually to fly over the confederated
States of South Africa; and for my part I would rather see
a confederation take place under a compound flag, composed
of equal parts of the Union Jack and Dutch ensign, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
bit of a French flag let in, to represent the Huguenots who,
on their first arrival in South Africa, formed one-sixth of the
entire white population of the country, and to whom the South
African Boers of to-day owe many of their most estimable
qualities, than have the country plunged into war in order to
enforce its acceptance of the Union Jack.</p>

<p class="i1">However, this flag question is a problem of the future,
and in the meantime it is the duty of all South Africans
who have the welfare of the country as a whole at heart to
do all they can to obliterate the remembrance of events galling
to the national pride either of Dutchmen or Englishmen, and
to endeavour to bring about once more a feeling of mutual
trust and confidence between the two races. The Dutch
must forget Slagter's Nek and Boomplaats, and the English
must learn to think no more of avenging the defeats of Laing's
Nek and Majuba Hill than they do of avenging the battles
lost by the British troops in America which culminated in
the surrender of Cornwallis and the declaration of American
independence.</p>

<p class="i1">Now there has been for some years past an association in
South Africa called the African Bond, which in some quarters
at least must be considered anti-British, since another association
called the Loyal Colonists' League has been inaugurated
to counteract its effects. This latter society, judging by some
speeches which have lately been made by some of its members,
is frankly anti-Dutch. Now, would it not be better, if, in
place of the latter society, whose object seems to be to
widen and accentuate the breach which, in the Transvaal at
least, is existent between the two races, an association should
be formed, which all clergymen of all denominations, including
ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church, should be invited to
join, whose object should be the gradual obliteration of race-hatred
and race-jealousy between the Dutch and British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
throughout South Africa, by the promotion of knowledge
amongst the ignorant and prejudiced of both peoples?—for
that, after all, is what is most required in order to bring
about mutual respect and mutual forbearance, and enable every
member of every State in South Africa to work under equal
laws for the general prosperity of the whole country, a prosperity
which can never attain to full fruition until the Dutch
and British have attained to a political unity throughout
South Africa as complete as it is to-day in the Cape Colony.</p>

<p class="i1">And now, after this long digression upon matters South
African, and the expression of many opinions which, should
they be read at all, will possibly only excite ridicule, coupled
with a rebuke upon my presumption in wandering from the
fields of sport and natural history, where I may be at home,
into the arena of politics, where, it will be said, I certainly
am not, let me say a few words about the present position
and future prospects of Rhodesia.</p>

<p class="i1">Should the lists I have given at the end of my book be
glanced through, it will be seen that the number of the
settlers who were murdered in Matabeleland alone at the
outbreak of the native insurrection, added to those who have
since been killed and wounded in the subsequent fighting,
amounts to over 300, or more than ten per cent of the entire
white population of the country at the time of the outbreak of
the rebellion, a proportion, I think, which ought to be entirely
gratifying to even the most determined enemies of colonial expansion
in Africa, whilst it gives the lie direct to the statement
which has so frequently been made, that the settlers in
Matabeleland have run no greater risks in fighting with the
Matabele in order to put down the rebellion than would
be incurred by a sportsman engaged in shooting hares and
rabbits at home.</p>

<p class="i1">I do not expect that the publication of these lists will call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the blush of shame to the cheeks of those who have been so
eager to vilify their countrymen in Rhodesia, but I do hope that
it will arouse a feeling of indignation in the minds of many
who have hitherto been more or less led astray by these dishonest,
spiteful, and unpatriotic mentors, and at any rate they
must be sad reading to all but the most prejudiced. However,
the rebellion can now, I think, be considered as almost
at an end. The Kafirs have entirely failed in their attempt
to kill all the white men in Matabeleland, and to re-establish
themselves as an independent nation. To the west, north-west,
north, north-east, and east, the impis which four months
ago had formed a cordon round all those faces of Bulawayo
have one and all been driven from their positions, and have
now broken up into hundreds of little bands, living in the
forests with their wives and children. From all the information
one can gather, the vast majority of these people are
already suffering from want of food, as their cattle are all or
nearly all dead from rinderpest, and a large proportion of their
year's supply of grain has been taken possession of or
destroyed by the white men. Under these conditions they
cannot hold out much longer, and they would probably have
already come in to surrender were it not that on the one hand,
knowing the exasperation caused amongst the whites by the
crimes they have committed, they are afraid to throw themselves
on their mercy, and on the other they are kept from
doing so by their chiefs, who having been the ringleaders of
the rebellion, and fearing that in case of surrender their own
lives at least would be forfeited, are still doing all they can to
prevent their people from submitting.</p>

<p class="i1">In the Matopos, Mr. Cecil Rhodes and Mr. Johan Colenbrander
are at the present moment carrying on negotiations
with the insurgent chiefs, which may or may not end in peace.
Should no satisfactory arrangement be arrived at, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
war be continued, the natives will be driven to desperation,
and it will not only require a much larger force than there is at
present in the country, but the expenditure of a vast amount of
money, and the loss of many valuable lives, before they can
be absolutely all killed or hunted out of the almost impregnable
fastnesses and hills honeycombed with caverns which
exist all over the large area of country known as the
Matopos.</p>

<p class="i1">Now I think that, in view of the enormous cost and great
loss of life that would be entailed by the decision to make no
terms with the natives, it would be better to accept their
submission on lines consistent with the future safety of the
country. The chiefs must stand their trial, but the lives of
all those who have had no part in the murder of white men,
women, and children, could be guaranteed. The whole
nation must of course be disarmed as completely as possible,
and the actual murderers of white people during the first
days of the rebellion must be shot or hanged. But should
these conditions be complied with, whilst at the same time a
large police force is maintained in the country, and the
native administration carried on in such a way that, although
the natives are treated with firmness, their grievances will
always be heard, and as far as possible remedied, I do not
think we need fear another rebellion.</p>

<p class="i1">Of course there are those who say that it is a great
mistake to hold any parley with them at all. Go on killing
them, they say, until the remnant crawl in on their hands and
knees and beg for mercy. Well, that end could only be
attained, as I have already said, at a cost of much money and
many lives; so I think that there are many here, who, some
for the sake of expediency and others for the sake of
humanity, would now wish to see this rebellion ended as
soon as possible, if it can be done in such a way as to ensure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the future safety of the settlers in the country. As soon as
the chiefs submit and their people are again located on the
lands from which they have been driven, I think there can be
no doubt that the country will, for the time being, be perfectly
safe for white men; for history has shown us that
when a Kafir tribe submits it does so absolutely for the
time being, and no murders of isolated individuals
are committed until the chiefs are ready for another insurrection.</p>

<p class="i1">It may of course be said that the Matabele have not yet
been thoroughly beaten, and that, having gained a good deal
of experience during the last five months, their idea in submitting
is to get in their next year's crops and then begin
again, on the principle of "reculer pour mieux sauter." But
is this at all probable? After the first war they were more
or less surprised into submission to the white men, the
greater part of them never having fought for their country at
all. Then they found that the shoe of the white man's rule
began to pinch, but they wore it for two years, and did not
attempt to throw it off until the country appeared to them to
have been left in an absolutely defenceless condition by their
conquerors.</p>

<p class="i1">They have now had their rebellion, and it has absolutely
failed, and they have lost at least twice as many men in the
recent fighting as they did in the first war. Nor is there any
longer a cattle question to excite their resentment, for the cattle
are all, or almost all, dead from the rinderpest. Therefore it
appears to me, that if they are disarmed as far as is possible,
and if a strong police force is maintained in the country for
the next few years, their submission can be safely accepted,
and the mass of the people be allowed to go unpunished; but
justice and common sense both demand that all who are
proved to have been implicated, either directly or indirectly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
in any of the murders which marked the outbreak of the
rebellion, shall be most summarily dealt with. They will be
gradually discovered, and some, it may be, may not be brought
to justice for years to come, but no mercy must be shown
them whenever or wherever they may be found.</p>

<p class="i1">In less than two years' time the railway now being pushed
on through the Bechuanaland Protectorate will have reached
Bulawayo; and if the natives can be kept quiet by a firm and
just rule until the advent of the iron horse in Matabeleland,
there is little fear of their ever again rising in rebellion
against the white man.</p>

<p class="i1">In the meantime the development of the country must
remain at a standstill, and the country retained as a British
possession, by an occupation which will be almost purely military,
as not only has the cost of living been rendered almost prohibitive
through the destruction of all the cattle in Matabeleland
and Bechuanaland by the rinderpest, and the consequent
substitution of mules and donkeys in the place of oxen for
draught purposes, but farming also has been rendered very
difficult, as, putting aside stock and dairy farming, no ploughing
can be done without oxen, nor can agricultural produce
be carried to market without the assistance of those useful
animals, for salted and acclimatised horses and mules are too
scarce and expensive to be reckoned on for farm work. The
rinderpest, therefore, has for the present put an end to all
European enterprise in the way of mining and farming in
Matabeleland.</p>

<p class="i1">People in England can only realise the disastrous effect
which this dread disease has had on the prosperity of the
country by endeavouring to picture to themselves what the
consequences would have been had a disease suddenly made
its appearance in Great Britain in the early part of the
present century, before the introduction of railways, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
destroyed ninety-nine per cent of all the horses in the British
Isles; yet even that would scarcely represent the extent of
the calamity from the effects of which we are now suffering,
when it is considered what an immense tract of barren
wilderness yet lies between Matabeleland and the nearest
railway station.</p>

<p class="i1">In the early part of this year there were over 100,000
head of cattle, all sleek and in excellent condition, in Matabeleland,
but when it closes, I think it very doubtful if 500
will be still left alive in the whole country. Even this loss
is small as compared with that sustained by Khama and
his people, who were the largest cattle-holders in South
Africa, and whose loss it has been computed, from reliable
data, exceeds 800,000 head of horned cattle.</p>

<p class="i1">However, the rinderpest is a calamity which is not likely
to occur again, but which, when it does occur, sweeps everything
before it both in Europe and Africa. That Matabeleland
as a whole is a country second to none in South Africa for
cattle-breeding is the opinion of everyone who has lived there
for any length of time and had the opportunity of studying
the matter. When, therefore, the rinderpest has died out,
and the railway has reached Bulawayo, the country will be
gradually restocked; and then, too, mining machinery will be
imported, and our mines will at last be worked with a result
which will give the final death-blow to all those who have for
the last six years been engaged in disseminating falsehoods
concerning Rhodesia.</p>

<p class="i1">From the statistics supplied to me by the Compensation
Board, which I have given in the form of an appendix, it will
be seen that a good deal of farming work had already been
done at the time of the outbreak of the rebellion, and that the
population of Matabeleland were not all "gin-sellers" or
"men who had gone out to Matabeleland in order to swindle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the British public, by inducing them to subscribe for shares
in worthless companies, whose so-called gold claims contained
no gold." The fact, too, that farmers and prospectors were
living all over the country in perfect health rather explodes
the theory of a noxious vapour rising to some four feet from
the ground which is so deadly to Europeans that all colonisation
of the country is impossible; but this, if I remember
aright, was the theory propounded by one of Mr. Labouchere's
"reliable" correspondents—a fit contributor, forsooth, to the
pages of <i>Truth</i>.</p>

<p class="i1">It is now known throughout South Africa that Matabeleland
and Mashunaland are white men's countries, where
Europeans can live and thrive and rear strong healthy
children; that they are magnificent countries for stock-breeding,
and that many portions of them will prove suitable
for Merino sheep and Angora goats; whilst agriculture and
fruit-growing can be carried on successfully almost everywhere
in a small way, and in certain districts, especially in
Mashunaland and Manica where there is a greater abundance
of water, on a fairly extensive scale.</p>

<p class="i1">As for the gold, there is every reason to believe that out
of the enormous number of reefs which are considered by their
owners to be payable properties some small proportion at
least will turn up trumps, and, should this proportion only
amount to two per cent, that will be quite sufficient to ensure
a big output of gold in the near future, which will in its turn
ensure the prosperity of the whole country.</p>

<p class="i1">Once let the railway reach Bulawayo, and given intelligent
legislation in the best interests of the settlers and miners in
the country, Rhodesia will soon prove its value to the
most sceptical; but the prosperity which I predict will, I am
afraid, be very much retarded, if not completely destroyed, by
the revocation at the present moment of the Charter which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
was granted to the British South Africa Company in 1889,
and the substitution of Imperial rule for the present form of
Government. For this reason:—Under the present régime
the Company's administrator is always accessible to the
people living in the country, and whatever local reforms
may be deemed necessary by the latter are always capable
of discussion, and can be acceded to by him on the spot,
without despatches having first of all to be forwarded to the
High Commissioner at the Cape, by whom they would be sent
on to the Colonial Office, with the result that a local reform,
urgently required, might be delayed for months or never
granted at all.</p>

<p class="i1">Under the Company's government, too, the administrator
himself would always be a man acquainted with the history
of the territories he was governing, and would be probably
one who not only had the prosperity of the country he was
governing deeply at heart, but who also would have a very
good idea as to how that prosperity was likely to be attained.
During the next few years, too, which will be a very critical
period in the history of Rhodesia, such an administrator
would always have the benefit of the advice of the man
through whose energy and genius the territories forming that
state have been secured for the British Empire. But should
this territory be converted into a Crown colony and governed
from Downing Street on hard-and-fast lines, some of them not
at all applicable to local requirements, with an administrator
very likely ignorant of his local surroundings, and possibly
out of sympathy with the settlers—Dutch and British—who
have made the country their home, nothing but disaster is to
be expected.</p>

<p class="i1">Surely the people who have stuck to Rhodesia through
good and evil times, and who, under the auspices of the
Chartered Company, have added a vast territory to the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Empire and laid the foundations of what will soon be a
prosperous colony, which, given an intelligent and adaptable
form of government, will be able to pay its way, ought to
have some say in this matter, and not be transferred unwillingly
to a rule which they know would be ill suited to local
requirements, and under which local enterprises would surely
languish for want of the fostering care which only a local
administrator can provide.</p>

<p class="i1">The white population of Rhodesia have had many a growl
at the government of the Chartered Company, but in most
cases they have got what they growled for—to wit, the extension
of the railways, both from the Cape Colony and the
East Coast; the reduction of the Company's percentage of
interest in the mines; and full and most generous compensation,
where the claims were just, for cattle destroyed in
the endeavour to stay the progress of the rinderpest, and for
all losses sustained owing to the late native insurrection.
Under Imperial rule they know that no compensation has
ever been granted for losses sustained through a native
rebellion, and they also know that little or no assistance
could be hoped for in the construction of railways or other
public works. Recognising all these things, having as an
object-lesson just before their eyes the wretchedly slow
progress made in Bechuanaland under the Imperial administration,
and knowing, moreover, that the Transvaal war of
1880-81, if not the loss of the Transvaal itself as a British
possession, was brought about solely by a Government from
Downing Street, through an administrator entirely ignorant
of local requirements and absolutely out of sympathy with
the people he was chosen to govern, can it be wondered at
that at a recent meeting of the Chamber of Commerce in this
town, the people of Bulawayo expressed confidence in the
government of the Chartered Company and in Mr. Cecil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Rhodes, representing as they do a corporation of capitalists
who hold the largest financial stake in the country, and whose
aims and objects are identical with those of the people living
in the country, whilst they resented the idea of being handed
over to Imperial rule without having their wishes in the
matter consulted, in order to please the Little Englander party
at home?</p>

<p class="i1">One of the most noteworthy features at the meeting to
which I have referred was the remarkable unanimity shown
by the British and Dutch on this subject, for the Dutch up
here believe in Mr. Rhodes, and have the most absolute
confidence in his ability to insure the prosperity of the
country. The natives, too, as has just been shown, look upon
him as their father; and I believe that through his influence
and the strength of his personality, a peace will soon be
arranged with them, which would have been impossible at
the present time but for his presence in the country.</p>

<p class="i1">"But everything else here is likely to be forgotten in presence of the wonderful
jungle scene which Mr. Rowland Ward has constructed.... This will certainly be the first of
the many attractions to which visitors will turn.... They will find themselves in presence of
a scene which is likely to keep their gaze for some time. Mr. Ward has made the most of his
limited space, into which he has collected the scenery and life which, in reality, is found
scattered over an area of many thousand square miles. On the right we have a trophy from Kuch
Behar, formed by His Highness the Maharajah, the most prominent feature of which is a tiger hunt.
We see a great group in the deep grass jungle.... Adjoining this are trophies
designed to represent generally the Fauna and Flora of India, by representative animals and birds,
picturesquely grouped in illustration of their life-habits."—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"The visitors ... were lost in admiration of Mr. Rowland Ward's masterly designs,
modellings, and general arrangement. The novelty is already known as 'the Jungle.'... The deep
grass jungle is occupied necessarily by many creatures which would not in their native wilds be
found in such close companionship.... The scene is rendered with true tragic
power."—<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"These numerous beasts ... seem to illustrate the Fauna of India in a most vivid
manner, and are very artistically prepared and arranged.... The entire trophy has been prepared
by Mr. Rowland Ward. This group will unquestionably be one of the leading attractions of an
exhibition which is already full of marvellous things."—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Fitted up with the most perfect completeness—a jungle—the work of Mr. Rowland
Ward.... The whole scene depicted is so life-like that one is startled by its vivid realism....
This jungle alone is almost enough to make an exhibition.... Besides, Mr. Rowland Ward has
designed and arranged such other scenes in connection with several Colonial
Courts."—<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Mr. Rowland Ward, of Piccadilly, provides what will probably prove the most
attractive feature of the exhibition, in the form of a series of picturesque trophies
representing India, Ceylon, South Africa, Canada, and Queensland."—<i>Sportsman.</i></p>

instantaneous photograph in their suggestion of life, but they surpass the most

<p class="ac p2">EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESS.</p>

<p class="i1">"To sportsmen the utility of these voluminous records can hardly be over-estimated.
In the majority of cases the accounts of the antlers and horns are illustrated by engravings;
and photographs of many of the animals yielding them, with the sportsmen grouped
around, are interspersed throughout the volume. We have thus the African elephant,
the Java ox (<i>Bos banting</i>), the Cape buffalo, and the Tibet and Pallah
antelopes."—<i>Field.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Sportsmen and naturalists alike will welcome the appearance of Mr. Rowland
Ward's 'Horn Measurements and Weights of the Great Game of the World,' which he
has just issued from 'The Jungle,' in Piccadilly. It is as complete a record as could
now be compiled of the leading trophies of the chase, gathered from all quarters of the
globe, chiefly, if not exclusively, by the enterprise and prowess of Englishmen, and leaves
nothing in this respect to be desired. No important collection of specimens has escaped
due notice, and the information which is given concerning them is not to be found elsewhere.
We may add that the copious illustrations with which the book is adorned,
whether they are the result of photography or of engraving, are excellent, and worthy in
every way to bear company with the letterpress of the distinguished naturalist and preeminently
skilful taxidermist with which they are associated."—<i>The World.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"It is not often that sportsmen and naturalists are enabled to make acquaintance
with such an elegant volume, and yet at the same time so valuable a work of reference, as
Mr. Rowland Ward's 'Horn Measurements and Weights of the Great Game of the
World,' published at 'The Jungle,' Piccadilly. Profusely illustrated, and bound in
material representing the hide of zebra, Mr. Ward's record will be necessary to the
library of every well-appointed country house."—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"In these days, when every one is striving to 'beat the record,' it is only right
that sportsmen should have clearly put before them the results already arrived at as regards the
size of the trophies and the weight of game-animals already obtained by their brother
Nimrods. No one is in so good a position to do this as Mr. Rowland Ward, to whose
well-known 'Jungle' in Piccadilly all the leading shooters of the present day send their
'heads' to be mounted and their 'skins' to be stuffed."—<i>Nature.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Both the sporting and zoological world owe a large debt of gratitude to Mr.
Rowland Ward for this handsomely-got-up volume, and he deserves the best thanks of all
those interested in the subject of Big Game, for the thorough and conscientious manner
in which he has completed a very laborious task, and we only hope that his efforts will
be rewarded by the book having such a rapid sale that a new edition will be called for
at no very distant date."—<i>Land and Water.</i></p>

<p class="ac p2">PUBLISHERS' ANNOUNCEMENT</p>

<p class="i1">Mr. Selous has spent twenty years in this portion of the world, during
the whole of which time he has led the wandering life of an explorer and
hunter. Regarded from a scientific point of view, his services have been fully
recognised by the Royal Geographical Society, who have presented him with
their Founder's Gold Medal, the highest honour in their power to bestow.</p>

<p class="i1">While in pursuit of large and dangerous game, Mr. Selous encountered
many hardships and had some hairbreadth escapes, the account of which he
gives in the graphic and entertaining style which gained such popularity for
his former work. At the present time, when Mashunaland, after having
passed through many vicissitudes, is being permanently settled up, and its
mineral wealth developed, an account of its history and resources, written by
Mr. Selous, who is so thoroughly acquainted with the country, and who guided
the pioneer expedition in their successful march from Macloutsie to the place
where Fort Salisbury now stands, cannot fail to be of the greatest interest.</p>


<p class="ac p2">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p class="i1">"There is not space in these columns to give illustrative extracts of Mr.
Selous's exciting adventures so graphically, because so simply and modestly,
told, so the statement must suffice that so many of them have never been
gathered between the covers of a single book.... As a record of hunting
adventures it is almost without equal."—<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Author needs no introduction.... Will doubtless become the standard
work of reference. Excellent and numerous illustrations."—<i>Field.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"It is impossible even to indicate all the points of interest with which Mr.
Selous deals. Illustrations are both numerous and excellent."—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Delightful book ... and is produced in a style befitting the reputation
of both author and publisher."—<i>Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Genuine story of adventure told in straightforward fashion, full of dramatic
incidents and hairbreadth escapes, and made especially interesting by the fact
that its author was the pioneer of the expedition to Mashunaland."—<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"From cover to cover the book is crammed with most interesting information
about the people, the country, the habits of wild beasts, mining
shooting, and the rest."—<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Captain Swayne's narrative of 'Seventeen Trips through Somaliland'
... serves to remind us how rapidly the waste places in the world are getting
filled up. His account of the big game shooting has a popular interest ...
minute information for the sportsman's guidance."—<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Will be carefully studied by those who have been there and those—and
there are many—who have an eager desire to go. It is full of thrilling
episodes.... The last chapter ... contains some highly interesting notes
on the wild fauna of the country. The appendices, which deal with the fitting
out of Somali expeditions and with the physical geography, have a distinct
value."—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Captain Swayne relates his experiences in a perfectly straightforward

<p class="i1">"Captain Swayne's 'Seventeen Trips through Somaliland' seems entitled
to more attention and authority than most hunters. Contains one of the fullest
accounts yet published of the life, customs, and characteristics of the restless
Somali tribes."—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"Is full of well-told adventure, which appeal alike to the casual reader,
the naturalist, and the sportsman. The drawings of the heads and animals
are excellent, and for some years to come this book should remain 'the book'

<p class="i1">"Sport, however, it must be borne in mind, is a thing of every climate and
of all seasons, and the manual referred to, 'The Sportsman's Handbook,' by
Rowland Ward, F.Z.S., has a little to say of most regions, from the North of
Scandinavia to the South of India. All knowledge is apt to come in useful;
and even those of us who may never know the delight of facing a charge of
the Cape buffalo—under some circumstances among the most dangerous experiences
of the sportsman, we are told—may yet find a less rapturous pleasure in
learning how a real sportsman should entertain such a visitor. The next best
thing to being able to shoot a lion in a workmanlike fashion is to know how
the thing ought to be done, and that is among the items of instruction in this
little book."—<i>Daily News, Leading Article.</i></p>

<p class="i1">"With this in his portmanteau, no one fond of shooting and collecting
need any longer lament his inability to preserve his trophies, since the directions
given for skinning and preserving animals of all kinds are extremely
clear and simple, and rendered all the more intelligible by the wood engravings
by which they are accompanied. Quadrupeds, birds, fishes, reptiles, and
insects are all dealt with in turns, and directions given not merely for
skinning them, but also for mounting them, if desired, a year or two (it may
be) after they have been procured."—<i>Field.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
